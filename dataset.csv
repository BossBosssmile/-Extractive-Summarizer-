Power Plant is a legendary cannabis variety
Power Plant has become a household name in the contemporary cannabis scene. Her exceptional vigor and excellent yield have convinced many growers of her class. This, together with her classic energetic and potent ""up-high"" ensures that she is a permanent item on the menu in almost every coffee shop in the Netherlands. It is also an easy plant to clone and thanks to these excellent properties Power Plant, together with White Widow and Amnesia Haze, is one of the most cultivated Dutch strains of all time.

What kind of genetics does Power Plant contain?
Power Plant is, alongside White Widow, one of Dutch Passion's best known varieties. Introduced in 1997, she quickly grew into a variety that every coffee shop wanted on their menu. The genetics of this strain originate from South Africa and are very stable, with enormous growth potential. Our original Power Plant has only been backcrossed, never hybridized and only available from Dutch Passion. An original classic from Dutch Passion, robust, very powerful and with gigantic yields!

Power Plant is an easy to grow cannabis strain with vigorous growth and exceptional yield
Power Plant is a fast flowering Sativa like no other. It is a very easy variety to grow, this is backed up by lots of positive customer feedback. It is therefore an ideal strain for the new grower. Even in the hands of a beginner, Power Plant will be able to produce a large yield. In the hands of an expert, very exceptional yields are possible in a relatively short average flowering time of 9 weeks.

She grows incredibly fast and vigorously during both the growth and flowering phase. This is a plant that is very tolerant of fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Due to her unique genetic background, she can withstand many different climatic conditions, which makes her ideal for a beginner. Crushing, bending and ‘supercropping’ are different growing techniques that are all possible. With this strain it is really a breeze to achieve a fat yield!

During the flowering phase this strain can stretch considerably, 200-300% stretching is the rule rather than the exception. This large stretch makes her the ideal lady for a SCROG grow. This makes shorter veg periods possible. In addition, it is also possible to put her directly on 12/12 after germination. That also makes her a very suitable plant for an extremely fast SOG cultivation. Her internode distance is short to medium which means she can produce very long well-stacked blooms. The generally long blooms, of about 30-50cm, have thin Sativa leaves and a very favourable flower-to-ratio.

The genetics used for Power Plant guarantee the following properties:

A large robust plant that can take a beating
A plant with long, full buds with a very high yield
The flowers smell very pungent, Power Plant has a strong terpene profile and a wonderful up-high
Power Plant is the perfect candidate if you are looking for a variety with a bumper harvest which does not require any special attention.

Effects of Power Plant
It is a THC rich variety with a complex aroma and a great ‘up-high’. Power Plant is uniform and has a very mild smoke. The Sativa dominant genetics give the user a positive, feel-good high. Her effect is super strong and hits very quickly! The high usually starts with a euphoric and energising effect. It's a strain that can give you the ‘munchies' (an appetite boost), so don't be too surprised if you're going on multiple trips to the fridge.

Eventually the high transforms into a more relaxed feeling with which you can rest on the couch, listen to music or just relax. This is also a great strain for social occasions. Make sure you have enough drinks because it will give you a dry mouth. It's a strong Sativa high with a creative vibe and an anti-anxiety effect that can last for several hours.

The flowering time of Power Plant
Despite the considerable stretch she flowers quite quickly. On average the flowering time is around 8-9 weeks. However, there are also some long flowering phenotypes that take about 10-11 weeks. An unstable environment can also cause her to take just a little longer to ripen completely. As mentioned before, the strain grows very fast, she has a large stretch after switching the clock to 12/12. This makes her a suitable candidate to grow directly from seed in 12/12 lighting conditions.

Plants then grow to an average height of 75-125cm. Her stretch lasts for about 3 to (maximum) 4 weeks and the first flowering hairs can already appear during week 3. This rapid development ensures that Power Plant can also be harvested relatively quickly. So for a classic Sativa dominant strain, she is much faster than most comparable strains available.

The yield of Power Plant
It is a fast flowering sativa with a very large yield (500-600 grams/m²) and an intense high. Power Plant is very stable with enormous growth potential. She received her XXL rating for good reasons, even beginners can achieve very good yields with this strain.

In the hands of a connoisseur, Power Plant will be able to deliver extremely high yields of between 600-750g/m². Outside, Power Plant can grow into a true monster and several kilograms per plant are possible. Early flowering phenotypes can also thrive in temperate climates, but dry and warm climates are advised.

There is currently plenty of choice in high quality, THC-rich cannabis seeds. But most of these strains are only medium yielders and some offer downright small yields. Power Plant is a strain developed for home growers and licensed producers looking for the highest possible yield.

Advice from our experts
With most strains a complete optimisation of the growing conditions is required to achieve a very high yield. With Power Plant, this XXL yield is more the standard. Power Plant is a strain that can handle all types of growing conditions and all types of growing methods. She does well in a SOG (whether or not on 12/12 from seed) and in a SCROG she excels. Her many branches, good elongation and long flowers with only thin slender leaves make her ideal for this growing method.

Keep in mind that only about half of your SCROG net needs to be filled before you put the plants into bloom. She will fill the net in no time! Supercropping, snapping and bending is recommended to control outliers. If you like mega long buds and a big yield, we recommend that you give Power Plant seeds a try!

Information about Power Plant
Power Plant is a cannabis strain with South African roots, created by Dutch Passion. The variety is almost entirely Sativa, with only a tiny bit of Indica genetics for speeding up flowering time, bud compactness and underlying physical effects. If you are new to the cannabis world and just starting to grow, this fast and strong Sativa is a perfect choice. Even those that have been growing for some time will appreciate her rich yield, pungent aroma and delicious high."

This is the perfect strain to get you through your day. But beware, if you smoke too much she can knock you out!

The flowering time of Amsterdam Amnesia
Amsterdam Amnesia has an average flowering time of 9 to 10 weeks. This is a fast Haze variety that stretches well within her short flowering time. Due to her relatively longer bloom time, though still very fast for a true Haze, she is not suitable for outdoor growing in temperate or colder climates. This strain thrives in dry sunny climates as well as in the tropics. She prefers a warm and sunny sunny climate.

Due to her strong, fast-growing branches, this sativa strain can be grown in both a SCROG and SOG setup. If you work with more plants per m2, you can work with short growing periods to reduce the seed-to-harvest period. This variety is also suitable for growing as a very large individual plant. In a SCROG with a long pre-growth period of 6-8 weeks, she can fill an entire grow room and provide a very high yield.

The yield of Amsterdam Amnesia
Amsterdam Amnesia is a high yielding sativa-dominant hybrid. Our Amnesia Haze guarantees an XXL yield. Expect extra high yields of full flowers with citrus notes and more compact buds than most other sativa weed varieties. The blooms grow really long and full. Especially when she is given room to grow. Her thick branches ensure that she can bear quite a bit of weight. An average yield of 500–600 g/m2 should be achievable for everyone.

In an indoor grow, the plants easily reach heights between 1-1.5 meters, even with a short pre-growth period. Therefore, it is recommended to manipulate this strain using breeding techniques. You can also top and fim her to increase width. Both LST and HST techniques have a yield-increasing effect on this cannabis strain. Outdoors in the right conditions this becomes a plant of epic proportions and plants between 3-4 meters are the rule rather than the exception! Yields can be up to 1.5 kg per plant.

Advice from our experts
Amsterdam Amnesia is a beautiful haze hybrid that will amaze anyone who has not yet experienced her exceptional bud quality. A true sativa and haze strain that is definitely at the higher end of the spectrum in terms of quality. In addition to her exceptional quality, this strain also has a fantastic yield. And it is not difficult to achieve.

She may require a little less nutrition than other strains, but as long as you don't overfeed her, she's pretty easy to understand. A tip is to start with a lower nutritional dose in the growth phase and build it up slowly. Keep in mind that haze strains can appear slightly lighter green than, for example, traditional indicas or Afghanis. But she must be green. As soon as she becomes light-yellowish it is a signal that she isn't getting enough nutrition! Increase your nutrient dose and make sure she receives a little more Nitrogen (N).

Do you want to achieve the highest yield with this Amnesia Haze? Then we recommend growing her in a SCROG setup. By constantly bending and securing her with tie-wraps you create a level canopy of buds. All these blooms will therefore receive the same PPFD (light) levels and thus have the potential to grow equally large and potent. For the tastiest result we recommend using organic food, this is also the ultimate/easiest solution for the beginner. Slow-release foods such as BioTabs are the ideal nutrient line to start with!

Information about Amsterdam Amnesia
Our Amsterdam Amnesia is already a real cannabis classic. Her smell, her taste and the potency of the buds are the main reasons to grow this strain. The high is also very powerful and long lasting. You will also be very happy with the final result! A real Haze that you just have to try!"

A strong robust outdoor plant suitable for all climates
It produces extremely high yields
Prize winning hybrid with beautiful purple colours and great mold resistance
For many years the favourite strain for outdoor growers worldwide
Frisian Dew, a cup winner that guarantees the highest quality
Frisian Dew won 1st place in 2008 at the Highlife Cup in the Netherlands. More recently, in the 2018 Homegrown Cup, Frisian Dew took 3rd place in the ‘Dutch Hash’ category. She has been an important part of the outdoor feminised seed collection for many years and still knows how to beat other new varieties with ease.

The buds of Frisian Dew are fruity and fresh
Frisian Dew is a perfect hybrid cannabis plant with a fresh, fruity, floral taste and aroma. It can vary from fruity (forest fruits) and slightly lemon-like to more pine-like and lavender. Some phenotypes smell a bit more like earth, ammonia and herbs - a characteristic from her Skunk parents. Her terpene profile is unique and provides a pleasant smoking experience. A beautiful outdoor feminised variety that also tastes great!

The buds of Frisian Dew are large and colourful
Frisian Dew is widely known for its great yields. It goes without saying that the buds can become very large and fat. It's that perfect blend of Indica and Sativa genes which take care of development, producing abundant growth and and heavy blooms. Most phenotypes also have a very favourable flower to leaf ratio.

Growing Frisian Dew outdoor offers the best yield
Frisian Dew is the best seller from our Dutch Outdoor cannabis seed selection. She was carefully crossed and selectively bred over many generations in Friesland, a province in the Netherlands. These genetics have more than proven themselves over the years. A classic outdoor feminised seed variety that will certainly not disappoint.

Frisian Dew has something called ‘hybrid vigor’. It is the result of a cross between a female Super Skunk and a male Purple Star. Shiva has created a very strong plant that grows fast and blooms exuberantly. Her Sativa genes provide long blooms and the Indica genes ensure compact buds. Together this combination makes for extremely high yields.

The name Frisian Dew comes from the area where this variety was developed. Frisian is the literal translation of ""Fries"" in English one of the northernmost regions in the Netherlands with its own language and strong cultural heritage.

This strong hybrid delivers experienced smokers with a powerful high which lasts quite a long time. Many outdoor growers simply find it the perfect high, nice for both the day and night. Smoke/vape a little bit more and the “couch-lock” takes over from the initial up-high.

Frisian Dew seeds are stable, strong and easy to grow
Frisian Dew is the result of years of crossbreeding/development of both Skunk and Purple genetics. This time consuming process ultimately produced a very stable and strong outdoor feminised seed variety. Her genetics are known for high yields and high quality. She is also very easy to grow. She doesn't need any special feeding schedules and she can handle just about any type of weather condition, cold and wet or hot and dry, Frisian Dew can handle it!

The majority of the plants will become strong and large. This strain is known for vigorous growth with large leaves and strong sturdy stems which don’t break easily. It is a lady that you must tame if you do not want her to grow into a huge bush.

Frisian Dew is a true classic outdoor marijuana strain of legendary proportions.
She isn’t suitable for indoor growing but is perfectly suited to outdoor growing and greenhouses. In the right circumstances and with the right care the plant can grow to one of epic proportions. Plants of 3.5 m high by 3.5 m wide are no exception. In most cases, Frisian Dew is ready for outdoor harvest in October (Northern Hemisphere). In greenhouses it can sometimes be a few weeks earlier in the right circumstances. But bear in mind that it is precisely during these last weeks that the most bud weight is produced by the plants. Harvesting too early can therefore lead to a lower yield.

Outside (and in greenhouses) she can reach a height of 3-4 m and is harvested during early/mid-autumn.

The genetics used to grow Frisian Dew guarantee the following properties:

Strong and vigorous growth both outside and in the greenhouse. Commercial production levels when grown under optimal conditions
A plant that is suitable for all types of weather, even in a cold and humid climate. It can provide large plants with a good yield
Large strong branches that are full of light purple flower clusters with a favourable flower-to-leaf ratio and a fresh, fruity taste
Frisian Dew is the perfect outdoor feminised seed variety for both beginners and experts. Even as a beginner it is easy to achieve large returns. In the hands of an expert, this strain can provide yields of a few Kg of dry cannabis flowers per plant. It is recommended that this strain is only grown outdoors or in greenhouses.

Effects of Frisian Dew
Frisian Dew has a strong hybrid effect, giving the user a great up high combined with a nice heavy 'body stone'. Smoke a little and you feel an energetic, creative high. Smoke a little more and let your body relax completely after a long day. If you are a fan of a boosting Sativa high, we recommend harvesting her a little earlier, but if you are a fan of the narcotic Indica high, we recommend leaving her a little longer. This provides more amber trichomes and a stronger body effect.

Frisian Dew flowering time
We recommend a minimum (pre) growth phase of approximately 3 -6 weeks. Outdoor plants can best be started indoors on an 18/6 light scheme. With this you ensure a stronger plant that has a better chance of survival. Germinating a feminised cannabis seed outside or putting a young seedling of a few days old outside brings all kinds of risks. If the plants are still small, they are less resistant to weather conditions. In addition, they can be eaten very quickly by a small pest, insects or other animals. The larger and healthier the plant is when she is planted outdoors, the greater the chance of a successful harvest.

Frisian Dew flourishes best in a mild/temperate climate, but she also performs well in a very hot or humid climate. She is generally more resistant to bad weather than most traditional cannabis strains.

The flowering time is around 8 weeks. It can be harvested at the Dutch latitude between the end of September and the end of October. In a greenhouse, she often flowers a little faster due to better conditions.

The yield of Frisian Dew
Frisian Dew produces extremely high yields, it is not categorised as an XXL variety for nothing. Both outside and in greenhouses it is possible to grow plants that yield several Kg of dried buds. Even a beginner will find it possible to harvest a few hundred grams per plant.

Advice from our experts
Frisian Dew is a strong plant that can handle just about anything, it even responds well to LST, supercropping and pruning . ‘Pinching’ or ‘Fimming’ are two other cultivation techniques which can be used several times during the growth phase to produce a more ‘bushy’ plant structure. This ultimately results in a shorter plant, but one with lots of side blooms.

For the best, tastiest result, we recommend that you cultivate her completely organically. With natural nutrients, taste is optimised. Therefore, with a good and healthy soil, plants are less susceptible to disease and fungus. Pay extra attention to dead leaves during the middle and end of flowering. Because of the heavy thick buds, dead leaves can cause top rot and fungi more quickly. You want to prevent this at all times!

More information about Frisian Dew
Frisian Dew is an outdoor winner and the best all-rounder from the Dutch Outdoor feminised seed collection. She flourishes in all climates and is very resistant to severe weather conditions. Her thick elongated buds are a real feast for the eyes! About 50% of the plants have purple hues in the tops. There are also completely green phenotypes.

Durban Poison,"Why should I get Durban Poison feminised seeds?
Classic, fully proven corner-stone variety

Very tough and powerful genetics which are easy to grow

Numerous side branches carry long and heavy flowers

Resinous Sativa blooms with a unique terpene profile
What does Durban Poison taste like?
Durban Poison is a Sativa dominant strain with a unique, appealing aroma. It is known for its spicy, hazy taste with hints of aniseed, liquorice, lemon and cloves. This complex aroma is one of the reasons why Durban Poison has such a large following of repeat growers.

Durban Poison Buds
The buds of Durban Poison are very dense for a Sativa. Growers can expect vigorous plants with numerous side branches. Most phenotypes have the tendency to stretch greatly, so be aware if height restrictions in your grow room could be a potential issue.

Durban Poison is a classic variety suitable for all conditions
Durban Poison is a classic indoor and outdoor variety, tough enough for outdoor cannabis growing even in extreme Northern/Southern latitudes. Durban Poison seeds come originally from South Africa and were inbred over many years during the 70’s. With each following generation, Durban Poison became increasingly adapted to the windy and rainy conditions of Northern Europe. Outdoor she has the potential to become really big. Heights above 3m are not unusual. Indoors she will stretch a great deal, so some form of height management is advised.

Durban Poison strain info: The perfect all-rounder!
Durban Poison is a pure landrace Sativa dominant variety which originates from South Africa. The plants may initially show wide Indica-style leaves. But during the latter part of the flowering period the growth pattern allows the Sativa dominance to show long flowers pierced by slim Sativa-style leaves.

Durban Poison has become a corner stone strain in today’s cannabis market. This Sativa dominant variety originates from the South African city of Durban and stood at the base of the famous GSC (Girl Scout Cookies) heritage/line, where strains such as Sherbet and Gelato were derived.

Durban Poison is ready to harvest after around 8-9 weeks of 12/12 indoor bloom. Outdoors she can reach maximum heights of 3-4m and is harvested around early/middle Autumn.

The genetics used to create Durban Poison ensure the following characteristics:

A tough and vigorous plant. Easy to grow and suitable for all growing conditions

A dense and slim Sativa style plant and bud structure

A unique terpene profile with oversized resin glands
Durban Poison is an old-school Dutch Passion classic. Available in both regular and feminized seeds.

Durban Poison effects
Durban Poison gained worldwide popularity due to its effects which are typically Sativa. It provides the user with a strong, uplifting and energising effect. It is the perfect strain to stay productive throughout the day or to complete creative tasks. It will put you in an elevated mood where you will still be able to face the outside world without feeling self-conscious or paranoid. The initial burst of energy can be followed by some more sedative effects if you smoke/vape larger amounts. The high is relatively long-lasting.

How to grow Durban Poison
We recommend a shorter veg period compared to most Indica’s or Hybrid varieties if you are growing these plants indoors without the use of grow techniques to control height.  Durban Poison tends to stretch a great deal, often doubling or tripling in size once in bloom.

A veg period of 3-4 weeks should be sufficient to get decent sized plants. When growing with only a few plants on a m2 it is recommended to use the SCROG technique. When growing her outdoors, make sure there is ample space available because this lady can take over your garden plot!

During early growth the plants can show more Indica-style leaves. A more sativa-style image and leaf appearance is seen during flowering. Indoor growers will notice the transition as soon as the light cycle is switched to 12/12. Outdoors as the days get shorter, the Sativa dominant heritage becomes more evident and her true colours appear.

Stems are tough and durable. They can easily be manipulated without the risk of breaking. During early flowering is it recommend to do some leaf tucking. This puts the biggest leaves underneath the buds which they once covered. The flowering time is about 8-9 weeks. In combination with the recommended veg phase it will take around 11-13 weeks from seed to harvest.

The yield of Durban Poison
Durban Poison produces XXL harvests of old-school quality cannabis; between 450 and 650 grams per m2 is possible. The plant will carry heavy, resinous and dense buds.

Our expert advice
Durban Poison is a perfect strain if you are looking for a well known old-school favourite with heavy yields which is easy to grow both indoors and outdoors. This variety suits both beginners and expert growers. For indoor growing we recommend topping or fimming as it will increase the speed of the Durban Poison lateral growth.

She will really shine when you use grow techniques such as LST, bending, supercropping and scrogging. This will increase yields greatly and it will make her height more manageable in an indoor environment. Make sure to give her enough root space. This will increase the speed of growth, as well as the eventual size and yield.

As soon as the plant starts to flower, you will see the more Sativa characteristics emerge more clearly. She eventually becomes a very tall, slender plant with thin leaves. The branches become quite thick, as do the flowers of this strain. With enough soil and sunlight, this becomes a plant of epic proportions.

Passion #1 has been developed purely for both outdoor and greenhouse cultivation. This is not a strain to grow indoors under strong lights. By the end of the flowering phase the plant is full of trichomes. Even the smallest leaves even have a good layer of resin. Passion #1 starts flowering in the last week of July/early August at Dutch latitudes. It is a very tough and resistant strain.

Because of the thin leaves and the open structure, fungus and bud rot have less of a hold on this cannabis strain. The buds become firm but not very compact, they remain slightly softer and more open in structure. Her long buds can easily reach 40-50 cm. These long, continuous blooms should be supported during the end of the flowering phase as they can sometimes sag completely due to the weight of the buds.

The genetics used to breed Passion #1 guarantee the following traits:

A strong hybrid outdoor variety with a very high yield
Potent buds with a thick resin layer and a high THC level
These plants are vigorous and grow very fast, reaching on average between 2-3.5 m tall
Passion #1 is a very stable and durable outdoor variety, she can withstand bad weather reasonably well, which makes her extremely suitable for growing in a moderate climate.

Effects of Passion #1
Passion #1 surprises you with a strong stimulating ‘up’ high. When you smoke more, you will get pleasantly stoned. We measured THC levels of nearly 20% on Passion #1. This makes Passion #1 one of the strongest outdoor varieties available. She has a hybrid high that has both a physical and mental effect. The high is strong and long-lasting. She mainly has an energetic, social up high. The physical effects are very subtle, they let you relax without really getting tired or sleepy. This combination of a ‘head high’ and a ‘body stone’ make this a well loved strain by a large group of repeat customers. Besides the strong high, this strain also has an excellent taste!

The bloom time of Passion #1
This variety has an average flowering time of about 6-8 weeks. The fastest phenotypes are ready from early September (in the Northern Hemisphere). The slightly longer flowering plants usually need until the end of September/early October to fully ripen. The plants reach an average height of 2-3.5 m outdoors when grown in good soil. In order to get the largest possible plants we recommend to start early with indoor germination and vegetative growth of the plants.

Passion #1 has been specially developed as an outdoor/greenhouse variety, this variety is therefore not suitable for indoor cultivation under powerful lights. She is known for her strong vigour. During both the growth and flowering phase this strain can grow quickly. She does very well as an open ground variety but can also be grown in pots. We recommend that you go for very large pots, of at least 50-100 L. If you want the very best result, we recommend using a smart pot of a few hundred litres in size.

The yield of Passion #1
Passion #1 starts flowering early in the season. The average dry yield varies from 250g up to about 750g per plant. Under optimal conditions the plants can grow to gigantic proportions (up to 3.5 - 4 m) and yields can exceed 1.5 kg of dry bud per plant. It thrives best in a greenhouse or in a sunny climate.

When the plant is grown in small pots, the yield will also be somewhat lower. But even in small pots, yields of several hundred grams per plant are possible. She is more resistant to bad weather than most traditional cannabis strains. Rain and cold have less of an impact on this strain. So if you live in an area with a rainy and cold climate, Passion # 1 can amaze you with a very good harvest! Preferably give her a sunny spot in your garden for the best results.

Advice from our experts
Passion #1 is a cannabis plant with a strong urge to grow vertically. If you want her to grow wider, we strongly recommend topping and/or fimming the plants several times. Without these growth techniques, this plant feels the need to grow further and further up. This can lead to very tall plants over 4 m high in the most favourable conditions. Thanks to this vigor and size, she naturally delivers a very high yield. You can also use the SCROG method outside, for example, to limit her height somewhat.

In order to be able to grow the largest plants, we recommend that the plants are started early indoors. In the case of the Netherlands, it is best to start around March/April. Germinating indoors and pre-growing the plants for at least 4-6 weeks ensures a strong plant that can take a beating before it is placed outside.

If you have even longer e.g. 8-10 weeks, we recommend repotting the plants several times to a larger pot, this is better for the root system. Do not forget to harden (acclimatise) the plants to outdoor conditions before they are permanently placed outside. You can do this by leaving the plants outside in a pot for a few hours every day for around 1-2 weeks. Start doing this in the morning and gradually leave the plant outside for increasingly longer periods.

Hollands Hope,"Why should I buy Hollands Hope feminised seeds?
It is a powerful and compact Indica that is very suitable for changeable climates with a wet and cold late summer

It is a relatively fast outdoor variety that can be harvested before the bad autumn weather has started

The weed has a real ""old-school"" aroma and taste and has been a favourite with outdoor growers for decades

It is a robust variety with strong branches and sturdy long flowers and a generous yield
Hollands Hope, the classic cup-winning outdoor variety
Hollands Hope won 1st prize at the Copa Del Mar in Argentina in 2013.

Hollands Hope has a fresh pungent aroma of lemon and pine
Hollands Hope has a wonderful ‘old school’ touch, the scent of this classic cannabis strain can best be described as fresh and fruity with heavier notes of pine and wood. The scent of her flowers is quite pungent and as soon as you light a joint, the strong aroma dominates. In terms of taste, it is slightly tart and woody with a spicy undertone. This potent Indica dominant hybrid takes you back in time to the 80s and 90s with its delicious classic cannabis taste and high.

The buds of Hollands Hope are large and compact
Hollands Hope has a good yield. This is mainly due to her large and sturdy flowers, dense blooms of 30-50cm are no exception. In some cases the plant grows up with a classic Christmas tree structure, with the lower branches and flowers just about as thick as the upper ones. This strain does not require any special attention and can also serve perfectly as a ‘guerrilla strain’. You can grow her in a forest or in a (corn) field and even in a mountainous environment. This strain generally does well with low nutritional needs.

Hollands Hope is a strong outdoor variety that is fully adapted to a moderate climate
Hollands Hope is available in both feminised seeds and regular seeds. It is a very potent indica that is fully adapted to the Dutch climate and has been grown outdoors since the 1980s. It is a strong and reliable variety, very resistant to fungi. This makes the plant extremely suitable for a moderate climate and also for the slightly more northerly countries. Whether you want to grow her in the wet Netherlands or the UK, this strain can tolerate quite a bit of bad weather. She grows best as an open-ground variety but is also excellent in pots. Make sure you have a large pot (at least 50L) because that benefits the root system and ultimately the yield of this lady.

Hollands Hope is a strong and robust cannabis plant, easy to grow and very resistant to bad weather conditions
Hollands Hope is a true ‘old school’ classic. This strain was developed in the 1980s when there were hardly any hybridised cannabis varieties for temperate climates. The strain became an instant hit. It amazed many growers with the fast flowering times, allowing it to be harvested before the bad weather started. In the Netherlands, Hollands Hope harvest was long before the maize crops were gathered in, a useful and important feature for guerrilla growers. This gave the strain enormous fame which eventually led to the original Dutch Passion Hollands Hope strain being mentioned in a Dutch TV cannabis series called ‘Hollands Hoop’.

The strain is an Indica dominant hybrid with a fast flowering time of about 8 weeks and a compact bushy (Christmas tree) structure. The plant grows slightly smaller than other outdoor varieties from our ‘Dutch Outdoor’ cannabis seed collection, such as Frisian Dew and Passion # 1. She grows thick, sturdy branches and large fan leaves. In terms of height, she usually reaches around 2m, but in very favourable conditions she can also grow a little taller. If you want to keep her slightly smaller, it is advisable to top her. This can even be done several times, bear in mind that she will then grow strongly in width, so there must be sufficient space for this.

Hollands Hope is a cannabis plant that is perfectly suited for growing in your backyard. Because of its compact growth, it is less visible than other outdoor varieties and you can grow it both in the garden and in pots. In addition, Hollands Hope can also be grown in a greenhouse, but try to provide some ventilation. If it is a greenhouse without ventilation, bud rot (or mold) can be seen in the compact buds of this variety due to too high humidity and too little fresh air (oxygen). Open both a window and the door of the greenhouse for better ventilation. For the best result, use a fan to ensure that more fresh air is blown through the greenhouse and that no stagnant air remains in the greenhouse.

The genetics used to breed Hollands Hope guarantees the following traits:

An easy to grow Indica-dominant outdoor strain that is very suitable for growing in your backyard, in a forest/field or in a mountainous area
A plant with a high resistance to bad weather conditions, even in a cold and humid climate, this strain does well
The compact plant structure makes for a medium-sized outdoor plant, her sturdy buds are long and full of a fresh, fruity and pine-like aroma
Hollands Hope is an ideal strain for outdoor growers and guerrilla growers. In fact, this strain does well with a little less attention and nutrition compared to other strains.

Effects of Hollands Hope
Hollands Hope is a reliable outdoor favourite with a heavy knock-out stone that is popular with recreational smokers and medical users. Her effect is mainly physical with only subtle mental aspects. It gives you a somewhat energised feeling and makes your body relax. This physical buzz is ideal for hanging out on the couch in the evening or when you are ready for a day off. Smoke Hollands Hope on a Sunday and you will notice that you will wake up very relaxed on Monday. The smoke experience is spicy and fresh and the excellent high lasts for at least a few hours.

The bloom time of Hollands Hope
This variety has an average flowering time of 8 weeks. The plants reach an average height of 1.5-2.5m outdoors with long blooms of about 40-50cm and can, of course, yield between 100g and 1000g depending on the growing conditions.

Hollands Hope is a real outdoor winner, but has also occasionally been cultivated indoors by our customers over the years. We usually do not recommend this, strains developed outdoors can react differently to an indoor climate with strong lamps.

To achieve the best results outdoors, we recommend to pre-grow her indoors for at least 3-4 weeks. Once the plant has a reasonable root system and a number of internodes, it is strong enough to be moved outside. It does very well in temperate climates and can be harvested at Dutch latitudes towards the end of September / beginning of October.

The yield from Hollands Hope
Hollands Hope is known for its high resistance to diseases, fast flowering time and good yield. Plants can yield an average of a few hundred grams per plant. In good conditions a yield of between 500-1000g is possible.

This Indica-dominant hybrid cannabis strain is a fast outdoor plant that can usually be harvested during early fall (late September, early October). The strain has sturdy buds that can hold quite a bit of weight. It may not be the largest outdoor plant in size, but it is one of the most compact. The combination of the fast flowering time with the large sturdy branches and full buds is the reason that many growers continue to grow this plant every year.

Advice from our experts
Topping and fimming are both good options for controlling her height a bit and creating more lateral growth. Make sure at all times that you defoliate her well during the flowering phase so that no dead leaves get stuck between the thick full buds. Dead / rotting leaves can cause unwanted fungi.

Over-fertilisation of Hollands Hope can stimulate excessive leaf growth and reduce bud production. Therefore it is strongly discouraged to use high doses of nutrition. It is best to grow her completely organically, she is suitable for ‘no-till farming’. Give this lady a nice sunny spot and she will reward you with a delicious Dutch harvest!

Outside in the northern hemisphere, our Durban Dew will be ready around September or October depending on the latitude you live at. She flowers relatively quickly once the days get shorter. Outdoors, the average plant will grow to around 2-3 meters in height. But with a little pre-growth, she can grow even taller than 4 meters. This is a plant of epic proportions.

Truly epic yields can be achieved outdoors and in greenhouses. Plants with a yield of around 500-1000g are the rule rather than the exception. For experienced growers, this is a record-breaking strain! It can be grown in pots as well as in the ground. Keep in mind that she prefers a large aerated container rather than a small plastic pot. And to achieve the best, tastiest results, we recommend growing her completely organically.

Advice from our experts
Durban Dew is a strong all-rounder. Actually, nothing is too crazy for her. Grow her preferably outdoors in the ground, in a pot, in a greenhouse or as a guerrilla plant in the forest. It is a strain that responds well to bending, snapping and supercropping. If you want to increase her yield, these techniques are recommended to get even thicker branches and flowers. If you want to limit her height somewhat, it is recommended to top or FIM this lady.

This makes her grow even wider/bushier. With a long vegetative phase, this process can be repeated several times. Towards the end of flowering for outdoor cultivation, we always recommend checking her for bud rot and mould. Although she is relatively resistant, she can still be susceptible to a number of small spots due to long periods of bad weather. If you are there in time, this will never cause a serious problem. Therefore, remove dead leaves in time and provide a shelter if necessary. It is therefore advisable to check the plants as harvest approaches.

The latest official lab result even came to almost 27% Delta-9-THC!

What exactly are the genetics in Skywalker Haze?
Dutch Passion Skywalker was a popular strain introduced in the late 1990s. Originally, this variety was developed by crossing two classic Dutch Passion strains: Blueberry x Mazar. This Indica dominant plant with her sturdy growth pattern and fruity notes, along with a great colour palette, have made this strain a go-to product for both domestic and commercial growers.

The Dutch Passion team of breeders has created a carefully selected new crossing of the classics Blueberry and Mazar. The result of this was crossed with a super potent and highly resinous elite clone of an incredibly potent Amnesia from the Amsterdam underground scene. We have given this gem the name “Amsterdam Amnesia”. The result of this (Blueberry x Mazar) x Amsterdam Amnesia cross is Skywalker Haze. Available in both this photoperiod feminised form and in autoflower form (Auto Skywalker Haze).

Skywalker Haze is a robust and stable Sativa dominant hybrid with a high yield and an exceptionally frosty appearance with beautiful colours in the buds towards the end of bloom
Skywalker Haze is a strong and robust Sativa. These ladies often have a vigorous growth and flowering phase, develop strong branches and are usually relatively large. Skywalker Haze is a haze hybrid with a short flowering time. On average, she takes 9-10 weeks to fully mature. This is relatively fast for a haze cannabis strain. She can stretch quite a bit during the flowering phase, especially for the first 2 weeks after being put on a 12/12 light cycle in a controlled indoor grow or when the days outside start to get shorter. It is a plant that adapts easily and is not difficult to grow.

As a result, she is also very suitable for novice growers who would like to grow a Haze strain. In terms of nutritional needs, she is also not difficult to understand, she is best grown in organic conditions, but also does well on coco or even on a hydro system. Skywalker Haze is a cannabis strain with a great leaf-to-flower ratio, her buds are also quite firm and compact. This makes it easy and quick to manicure. This, combined with her high terpene and THC levels, makes her very popular with both home growers and commercial growers worldwide.

The buds of this strain are compact, hard and bursting with resin. It is recommended to work with new carbon filters when growing indoors. The flowers can smell very strong and pungent. The aroma is usually fruity and spicy, but can sometimes be very sweet. In terms of taste, this strain stands out from the crowd!

Skywalker Haze generally has a short to medium internode spacing. The branches are nicely filled with flowers. It is known that the top blooms can easily reach a length of 30-40 cm and become quite large in size. It is a Sativa-dominant plant that can grow quite tall, both indoors and outdoors. Topping/fimming her and using LST or the SCROG technique will give you some control over her height.

This strain can be grown indoors or outdoors, but outdoor cultivation in temperate climates or very northern or very southern regions is not recommended. Due to the longer flowering time, she can take just a little too long to mature before the weather changes and causes problems.

The genetics used for Skywalker Haze guarantee the following properties:

A medium to large commercial haze hybrid with a very favourable flower-to-leaf ratio
Skywalker Haze is a potent cannabis strain with a powerful terpene profile, her strong aroma and taste are suitable for the real connoisseur
These cannabis plants can grow relatively large. The good stretching phase in combination with the beautiful Sativa-dominant, yet compact, buds ensure a real XXL yield
A stable, easy to grow Haze that takes on average around 9-10 weeks to fully mature and is suitable for all types of growers, even beginners.

Effects of Skywalker Haze
Skywalker Haze has a powerful effect and a long-lasting high. This high is a combination of a head high and a body stone. But the head rush is noticeably stronger than the physical effect. The high is therefore euphoric, energetic and cheerful, which is typical of the effect of a Sativa dominant cannabis plant. Due to her high THC percentage of around 20%, you can count on a strong and long-lasting effect.

This is a wonderful high that transforms over time into a relaxed and laid-back feeling. The Indica genes in this crossing provide a subtle, but significant, relaxed after-effect. It is therefore a fine strain for both medical and recreational smokers looking for a hybrid cannabis strain with a hybrid high. When you consume more of this strain, it becomes a real creeper, the high becomes very powerful, long lasting and can last all day. Ideal for when you have a day off or have nothing planned at all. Sunday chill like never before!

The flowering time of Skywalker Haze
Skywalker Haze has an average flowering time of 9 weeks. However, there will also sometimes be plants that need just a little longer and, for example, have to bloom for 10 to (max) 11 weeks to fully ripen. Especially when the climate is not optimal. Her stretching phase during flowering makes this a nice plant to grow in a SOG with a short pre-growth phase. Outdoors, Skywalker Haze can only be grown in the slightly sunnier and more arid climates.

She is not suitable for growing in the more cold/wet northern or southern regions. In the Mediterranean area, however, she will also do very well. When grown in a sunny and warm climate, this strain is at her best. At the end of the flowering phase, the plants will be packed with beautiful white buds, covered with bright orange hairs and a thick layer of resin. In areas with cold night temperatures, blue and purple hues will sometimes appear in the flowers and on the leaves.

The yield of Skywalker Haze
Skywalker Haze is a plant with a very large XXL yield. Her flowers can grow into very long continuous blooms up to 45-60cm long in the most favourable cases! On average she will grow long blooms of about 20-30 cm with a short to medium internode distance. This ensures that they can grow densely and therefore yield heavily. But even when that doesn't happen, the compactness of the buds adds more weight than you would imagine from such a Sativa-dominant appearance.

When the harvest time has come, you can count on a very large yield. Perfect for building a head-stash that will last you for months! Skywalker Haze can also produce very large yields in an indoor grow. A yield of 500-600g/m2 is therefore achievable. In the hands of an expert, even more is possible and you can easily exceed 600 grams. Outdoors, plants will yield a few hundred grams on average, but if grown in a very sunny and dry area, yields of 500-1000g per plant are also possible.

Expert advice when growing Skywalker Haze cannabis seeds
Skywalker Haze is a Sativa-dominant hybrid Haze variety that clearly inherited a little more of the Sativa genes from her parents. The degree of stretch as well as the branch, leaf and top structure are more like that of a Sativa than an Indica. Although the buds often show foxtails, they still become quite hard and compact, not fluffy at all. Fortunately, that part of the Indica genes came along in this crossing ensures the high yields.

If you want to get the most out of this strain, we recommend using different growing techniques. Both LST, mainlining and topping/fimming can increase yields. In that case, allow for a slightly longer veg period so that the plants can recover. If you use a SCROG net, you can really take this strain to new heights. She's also easy to bend, snap and super crop, so if a plant or bloom is getting too tall, don't be afraid to manipulate this branch to create a more even foliage.

Skywalker Haze information
The Dutch Passion team is very proud to present Skywalker Haze. This feminised strain is one to be reckoned with. She produces huge yields of top-notch buds. Furthermore, her taste and high are out of this world. We can go on praising Skywalker Haze endlessly. But you really just have to experience it for yourself!"

Both the THC Bomb and the Bubba Island Kush contributed to the potency of this new strain and the relatively fast flowering time. The Critical Orange Punch, on the other hand, has slightly increased the volume and thus the yield. Combining these 3 strains has created a new strain that is unparalleled. The combination of potency, taste and heavy yields is usually the blend that every grower wants.

Sugar Bomb Punch has compact flowers and is one of the strongest varieties in our collection
Sugar Bomb Punch is an Indica-leaning hybrid cannabis strain that was created by carefully crossing different types of genetics. This strain belongs to our ""USA special"" family and produces some of the most potent cannabis buds you will come across. THC values are between 20-25% without too much effort.

Sugar Bomb Punch shows more of a hybrid leaf structure during the vegetative growth phase. This leaf structure is somewhat thinner/slimmer than you might expect from such a relatively fast bloomer. In late growth, as well as in bloom, the leaf structure changes slightly towards the Sativa side. She remains fairly compact, which makes her easier to handle than most Sativa dominant hybrids. Her branches are strong and respond well to bending and cracking.

Most phenotypes start to bud early in the flowering phase, usually after 2 to 3.5 weeks. At that time they also start producing trichomes very rapidly. After a good month of flowering the buds are already full of resin. Even the leaves seem to have been snowed under. When you touch the plants your hands and fingers stick together and you understand why we named this strain Sugar Bomb Punch. Some plants can be ready within 7.5-8 weeks, these are the fastest phenotypes. Others really need at least 8.5 to 9 weeks. Most plants remain fairly compact, so it is recommended to take this into account.

Her plant structure is best described as compact to medium. The internode distance is relatively short and the leaves are of a hybrid structure that leans towards the Sativa side.

The genetics used to create Sugar Bomb Punch guarantee the following properties:

A plant completely covered with glittering white super-sticky buds.
A complex aroma and a potent cannabinoid profile with high THC levels.
Compact plants and buds that are easy to harvest thanks to the good flower-to-leaf ratio.
Sugar Bomb Punch is the ideal strain for hardcore smokers looking for the stickiest buds and highest THC levels.

Effects of Sugar Bomb Punch
Sugar Bomb Punch has a seriously strong high. Because of her high THC level she hits like a bomb! A small bud is sufficient for a powerful joint. The effect may vary by phenotype. You may find plants with a slightly more Indica leaning properties. These can produce stronger physical effects which are very relaxing and will leave your body completely rested and soothed. Others, on the contrary, will have a stronger Sativa high. This is more of a psychoactive cerebral high, stimulating, energetic and social. With all phenotypes, a euphoric and blissful feeling predominates and you can enjoy a ""feel-good high"" that will last for several hours.

The flowering period of Sugar Bomb Punch
Sugar Bomb Punch is a compact to medium sized cannabis plant. The stretch varies from average to below-average. This varies according to the phenotype. Sugar Bomb Punch is a very beautiful plant. The leaves look lively with beautiful serrated margins and a bright green color. It takes an average of 8-9 weeks to flower. But there are phenotypes that only take 7 weeks in bloom and an extra week after that to harden completely.

We recommend a slightly longer vegetative growth period for this strain, so that the yield can be even higher. Due to its limited stretch during flowering, you will either have to grow vegetatively a little longer or work with more plants per m² to achieve real XXL yields.

The yield of Sugar Bomb Punch
Sugar Bomb Punch is a very good yielder, with yields in excess of 500+ g/m² possible in a wide range of conditions and growing techniques. Her unique leaf and plant structure makes it possible to grow her in both a SCROG and SOG. The thin leaf structure ensures light reaches down to the lower and smaller buds.

Outdoors, she can grow into a monstrous ""bushy"" plant that can produce up to 750g per plant. Sugar Bomb Punch seeds are less suited for cultivation in the more northern latitudes. A sunny, dry Mediterranean climate benefits her the most and is therefore preferred.

Advice from our experts
Sugar Bomb Punch can grow slightly slowly in height during vegetative growth. This is because she grows in very bushy structure, compact and with a lot of leaves. That is why we recommend defoliating the plant several times during the growth phase so that the side branches and buds will receive more light. Topping or fimming is possible and will increase the yield.

Do you want to lift the quality of the flowers to the highest possible level? Then we recommend using a UVB lamp during the last 3 weeks of the flowering phase (from week 6-7 for 3-4 hours a day). This can allow THC levels to rise to unprecedented heights!

Information about Sugar Bomb Punch
Sugar Bomb Punch is the result of a time-consuming breeding process by crossing different types of 'USA genetics'. This strain has been developed with the aim of obtaining the whitest, stickiest and most potent buds and it comes with our highest recommendations."
C-Vibez,"Why should I buy C-Vibez feminised seeds?
She is one of the most potent cannabis strains in our collection. THC levels of 20-25% are the rule rather than the exception.
It is a strong plant that grows quickly and is suitable for all grow techniques.
C-Vibez is known for its high yields and excellent bud quality.
This is the strain of choice for “pheno hunters"" and growers who want to choose from a variety of high quality phenotypes. The range of plants, each with their own taste and odour profile make this strain unique.
C-Vibez has a sweet and fruity character with floral and pine-like notes
All C-Vibez plants look super frosty. In general, the aroma is best described as sweet and fruity. There are also phenotypes that lean more towards the traditional Haze aroma, slightly acidic, piney and spicy. But this is never the dominant aroma. Other phenotypes can smell a bit more like a Cheese strain - a bit musty and chewy, like opening a bag of cheetos!

By deliberately not fully stabilizing this strain, the spread of phenotypes ensures that there is something beautiful for every grower.

C-Vibez is covered with trichomes and one of our most potent varieties
C-Vibez is one of the strongest cannabis strains in the Dutch Passion cannabis seed collection. With consistent, extremely high THC levels of between 20-25% this strain belongs firmly in our exclusive ‘Extremely High' THC seed category for a reason. Every single phenotype we sent to the lab came back with over 20% THC! The perfect cannabis strain for the more experienced smokers among us!

Which genetics are in C-Vibez?
C-Vibez is a cross of Mad Scientist x Voodoo. Genetics have thus been created by carefully crossing Mad Scientist with our old-school Voodoo genetics. Voodoo is a very potent original Thai variety from Dutch Passion. These genetics provide the strong ‘stone’ that users will experience when smoking/vaping her. Crossing two heavyweights has ensured that these genetics have inherited a powerful cannabinoid profile. A minority of the plants produce color in the buds. There is even a phenotype with completely purple flowers!

By crossing a more Indica dominant hybrid (Mad Scientist) with a Sativa dominant hybrid (Voodoo), these genetics can provide a variety of phenotypes in terms of flowering time, plant structure, taste and smell. But not in terms of potency, which is the same for all of the phenotypes!

C-Vibez has long heavy buds completely covered with glittering trichomes
C-Vibez is a Sativa dominant hybrid cannabis plant that belongs to our ‘Classics' family of cannabis seeds. By using the original original Dutch Passion Voodoo genetics and Mad Scientist, these ‘old-school' genetics have been given a new look.

C-Vibez is known as a vigorous plant which can grow fast and hard. This strain can produce very large fan leaves during the growth phase. Bigger than both of your hands together! In general, the ladies grow quite compact and bushy. But there are also phenotypes that show a more open, Sativa-like structure during growth. These will be the largest plants! Do not wait too long to start the flowering phase because this strain can stretch quite a bit in bloom.

She is suitable for all types of growing techniques and growing methods such as ‘topping and fimming’ and LST (Low Stress Training). You can also bend/crunch the stem/branches as well as ‘Scrog’ grow her. Everything is possible and this lady can be tamed quite easily!

Keep in mind that she must be defoliated both in the growth phase and the beginning of the flowering phase. This ensures that all branches and growth shoots get more light, growing faster with heavier final yields.  Most plants continue to grow until about week 4 of flowering. The longest flowering phenotypes will grow for a week longer.

Her plant structure is best described as medium to large. The internode distance is medium and the leaves have a hybrid structure with mainly Sativa characteristics, thin and long with a slender shape.

The genetics used for C-Vibez guarantee the following properties:

A plant with beautiful heavy buds and extremely high THC levels.
Strong, easy-to-grow plants which are suitable for different cultivation techniques and grow methods.
Large plants with a high yield and different taste/odour profiles.
C-Vibez is the perfect strain for growers looking for variation within the same strain, there is always a phenotype that will blow your mind!
Effects of C-Vibez
C-Vibez buds are extremely potent which makes for a very strong, long-lasting high when consumed. The high is a combination of both a physical and mental effect. The high comes on nice and quietly. Initially she gives the user an energetic, euphoric and creative feeling. As soon as you smoke/vape a little more, the high starts to get stronger and heavier.

Eventually the experience evolves beyond the cerebral high into more physical effects. Your eyes become red, your body becomes relaxed and you enter a wonderful relaxed intoxication! Our test team was very impressed with the way this strain works. The smoke may initially seem subtle but the effect is strong and very pleasant!

The flowering time of C-Vibez
C-Vibez is a cannabis strain which will produce medium to large plants. During the flowering phase this strain can stretch quite a bit. Perhaps not to the same extent as a pure Sativa, but for a hybrid cannabis plant she can grow reasonably tall. This of course varies according to each phenotype. But in general C-Vibez can more than double in height during bloom.

In general, a flowering phase of between 10-12 weeks will apply. The fastest phenotypes will be ready in around 9-10 weeks and the most Sativa dominant phenotypes will need a week or two longer. They can sometimes bloom for 13 or even 14 weeks to fully ripen. These longest flowering phenotypes are the plants with the highest yield and highest potency, so they are definitely worth the wait.

The yield of C-Vibez
C-Vibez has received an XXL rating for a reason - she can put a lot of weight on the scale. The longest flowering phenotypes yield the most. But all plants will produce a high yield, even the somewhat smaller phenotypes.

In the right conditions, C-Vibez can yield between 500-600g/m2. Outdoors, she can grow into a true monster and plants can eventually reach over 3m in height with good organic soil and plenty of sunlight. This, of course, is only if the growth phase is long enough to achieve this.

We do not recommend growing her outdoors in temperate climates. The species usually blooms for too long to fully ripen in these climatic conditions. Only in the somewhat drier and mainly warm and sunny climates will this species thrive outdoors.

Advice from our experts
C-Vibez does well in both a SOG and a SCROG setup but can also be grown completely naturally. She is very resistant to bending. Her branches are strong enough to support all the buds, even in late bloom when the buds are at their heaviest.

We recommend defoliating her several times so that the branches and growth shoots receive more light and can develop better. This benefits the yield. Topping and fimming is possible. Cracking/bending the main stem is also a good option. Some main tops become very large and heavy, you don't want to miss them!

Information about C-Vibez seeds
By deliberately not completely stabilizing this strain, many different phenotypes can be found. This makes the strain ideal for ‘pheno-hunters’ and growers looking for a strain which delivers different types of flavors, scents, colours and effects. About ¼ of the plants can get purple and pink colours in the buds, these are the most special in appearance.

In a packet of C-Vibez seeds it is not difficult to find different phenotypes which will appeal to you. Some will have effects which may suit you at different times of the day, or for different moods. Have fun hunting for your favourite phenotype!"
HiFi 4G,"Why should I buy HiFi 4G feminized seeds?
It is an uncomplicated strain that makes good yields easy to achieve, even for beginners

It is a robust, fast-flowering variety with thick, sturdy branches and exceptional vigor. Well suited to the SOG method or for growers who like to grow their plants naturally

HiFi 4G is a very strong THC-rich cannabis strain. With a refined genetic background you are guaranteed a potent end result

If you are looking for a strong and fast Kush variety, Hifi 4G is the way to go. A unique terpene profile and pungent aroma provides a great taste experience, making it an ideal strain for making concentrates
HiFi 4G has an earthy, spicy, woody aroma with sharp and fruity notes
HiFi 4G has an unmistakably pungent Kush aroma. Most phenotypes will generally smell like a strong American Kush. This strain is most like an OG Kush, with a spicy, earthy aroma and sharp notes of citrus and coniferous trees. This variety has a wide variety of terpenes and both Alpha-Pinene and Beta-Pinene, plus the more common Myrcene and Limonene terpenes. All are strongly represented in the terpene profile. Hi-fi 4G fills the room with a pungent weed smell in no time.

HiFi 4G is a robust cannabis plant with sturdy branches and large flowers
This plant is known for its exceptional vigor and its sturdy thick branches. During the growth phase she seems to grow a bit faster than most hybrid strains. Even the stems of the leaves are firmer and thicker than usual. Because she has such stiff branches, it is more difficult to snap and bend her. She prefers to grow straight upwards, which makes her very suitable for a SOG setup. The sturdy branches are surrounded by large and long blooms, which in some phenotypes can grow to more than 40-50cm.

What kind of genetics does HiFi 4G contain?
At Dutch Passion we constantly keep up with the latest developments in genetics and our North American network remains a valuable resource. The result of our latest project is HiFi 4G. This cross was made with the parent WiFi OG and our award-winning resin-infused Glueberry OG. By crossing these two strains a very strong and potent new Kush variety has been created. It combines potency of the WiFi OG parent with the great aroma of the Glueberry OG. The more earthy, sour diesel aroma of the Wifi OG comes together with the more fruity, earthy aroma of the Glueberry OG. A delicious new mix of terpenes!

HiFi 4G has long compact buds with a very high cannabinoid profile
Hi-Fi 4G grows faster than you might expect from an Indica-dominant Kush variety. In the vegetative phase she grows quickly, but even in the flowering phase there is quite a bit of stretch in the plants. Perhaps slightly more than what you would expect from a cannabis plant with a flowering time of about 8 weeks. Most plants have a hybrid plant structure that will lean a little more towards the Indica side.

It is best not to try to break or bend Hi-Fi 4G. The stiff branches can break easily, especially during the growth phase and are not easy to manipulate. That is why it is best to grow this strain naturally or in a SOG setup. With the latter method you can immediately achieve the highest possible yields. Her thick flowers get more light in a SOG and you get the most weight from these main buds.

During the flowering phase, the plants have quite a stretch, they will continue to grow for about 3 weeks after switching the clock to 12/12. Her internode distance is short to medium. Even with the phenotypes with a slightly longer internode distance, the spaces are completely filled with flowers. These phenotypes also have a very favourable flower-to-leaf ratio, which makes them a favourite among growers.

Trichome production is a bit slow at first, but around week 6 of 12/12, resin and trichome production is really in full swing and sometimes takes just a few weeks before they can be cut. Her THC level is very high. After several lab tests lab tests have shown that this strain can reach well above 20% THC and therefore belongs to our exclusive category of 'Extremely High THC seeds’. This is reserved only for cannabis seeds with an extremely high THC potential.

The genetics used for HiFi 4G guarantees the following properties:

A compact medium sized plant with stiff branches and large flowers
Large sticky flowers with a very strong Kush aroma
Shimmering buds with an extremely high THC content
HiFi 4G is a strain that is suitable for real Kush enthusiasts who love a pungent aroma, a strong taste and a powerful high

Effects of HiFi 4G
This strain is ideal for relaxing, especially listening to music. HiFi 4G seems to enhance your appreciation and enjoyment of music. Your HiFi set comes to life, sound seems richer, deeper and sharper as if you were standing next to the musician or artist. This THC rich feminized variety combines a creative, pleasant high with a mentally calming effect. Due to its potency, it is not necessary to smoke a lot of this strain to enjoy a powerful effect. The high is long-lasting and very relaxing.

The flowering period of HiFi 4G
HiFi 4G flowers in an average of 8 weeks, making it one of the fastest flowering photoperiod plants in the collection. In unfavourable conditions, the flowering phase can take a little longer and she will need about 9-10 weeks of flowering to fully mature.

During the first 2 weeks of the flowering phase, the plants grow quite fast. After about 3 - 3.5 weeks the stretching finally comes to an end. That's when the buds start to develop further. During the following weeks the development seems to be slow. But from week 6 it suddenly goes really fast, the buds become fuller and more compact every week. The flowers grow into long calyxes filled with glittering trichomes and a wonderful pungent scent!

The yield of HiFi 4G
HiFi 4G has a fast flowering time and a high yield. Her long, thick and compact buds are the reason why this strain has received an XL mark. In the right hands, she can grow into a plant with XXL buds and reward the grower with a more-than-generous harvest. Grow her in a SOG for the highest possible yield. Her main buds alone can yield around 25-30g with ease!
On average, yields of between 400-500g/m² are possible. In an ideal climate and with the right growing techniques you can even achieve up to 600g/m², but this requires some knowledge and experience with growing.

Outside, HiFi 4G can grow into a true monster! Her thick branches and compact structure are ideal for protecting herself from the wind and providing sufficient support for her heavy buds. However, these compact buds can be a problem during the end of the flowering phase, especially in wet and damp areas. Therefore, it is recommended to grow her only in areas with a good late summer or a dry climate.

Advice from our experts
HiFi 4G is an easy to grow plant and suitable for beginners, but she can be challenging for the experienced growers to fully master. After a few rounds with this lady you will learn to fully understand her and she can really deliver extremely high yields.

This variety mainly excels in a SOG indoors and is well worth a try in a setup with pots of 4-7 litres or up to 11 litres. Remove the lower branches early so she can fully focus on the main bud and a few side buds. Keep the humidity strictly below 45% and experience her immense compact buds! It is best grown outdoors in a greenhouse or under a shelter. But always ensure adequate ventilation and the lowest possible humidity at all times.

More information about HiFi 4G
Good yields are easy to achieve with this straightforward strain. A rich and delicious terpene profile, exceptional vigor and a thick layer of beautiful trichomes make this XL variety a perfect candidate for making concentrates, for example."
Jorge’s Diamonds #1,"We are pleased to work together with Jorge Cervantes in our mutual project: ""Jorge’s Diamonds"".

Watch out if you brush your clothes against this aromatic fruity variety in late bloom - you will retain the powerful fruity scent of this potent feminised seed variety for quite some time!


Dutch Passion Passion Fruit: High yields of premium potency
Passion Fruit quickly gained a reputation amongst repeat growers for its unique terpene profile, high yields and potent flowers. It is the result of crossing two very strong and stable genetic lines into something new and exciting.

The Passion Fruit name was derived from the appealing smell and great taste of the buds. It is slightly sour, sweet and fruity with a hint of grapes which reminded the Dutch Passion test team of real passion fruit.

Passion Fruit is a hybrid cannabis variety that would be best described as a 50% Indica/50% Sativa variety which leans slightly to the Sativa side. However, due to the Indica heritage, you may be lucky enough to find the Indica leaning phenotype as well. Passion Fruit has what is known as hybrid vigor. This means that she has the genetic disposition to grow particularly quickly and explode during flowering. This makes Passion Fruit an ideal candidate for both a SOG style of growing as well as growing under 12/12 light from seed. Passion Fruit is also well suited to SCROG growing techniques with just a few plants (or perhaps only 1 plant) per m2.

Passion Fruit responds very well to bending and supercropping. Topping and fimming is recommended if you want an even bushier plant structure. Passion Fruit is a high yielding feminised cannabis seed variety. In the right hands she can reward the grower with an extraordinary large harvest and that’s the reason she was marked as an XXL variety.


Passion Fruit variety info: A tasty high yielding hybrid!
Passion Fruit is a well-balanced hybrid. The genetics come from Sweet Pink Grapefruit which was crossed with the multiple cannabis cup winning Orange Bud. This unique cross ensures one of the richest and tastiest flavor profiles in the Dutch Passion collection! The hybrid vigour from crossing these two strong varieties ensures excellent results. The roughly 50/50 indica/sativa ratio delivers a superbly enjoyable well-balanced high which will quickly become one of your favourites. It’s unusual to find a high THC variety that boasts such heavy yields alongside a genuinely unique terpene profile.

Being a cross of our original Orange Bud makes Passion Fruit very stable and easy to grow. Orange bud was selected in the 1980’s from outstanding Skunk genetics which produce dense and hard buds covered in crystals and beautiful orange hairs. The wonderfully coloured, crystal covered Orange Bud nuggets deliver a great taste to ensure outstanding bag appeal. Orange Bud is also noted for a uniquely sweet taste with citrus tones of nectarine and ripe orange.

Sweet Pink Grapefruit is thought to have originated in Canada, although the precise original genetics are uncertain and shrouded in speculation. Some say it started with a very fruity Northern Light phenotype, others say it was part of breeding program with a special Blueberry line. What can be said for sure is that this variety produces an extremely intense, exotic and sweet taste rarely found in other cannabis varieties.

Passion Fruit can show quite a compact growth pattern during the vegetative growth period. She can have both thick stems and big/broad fan leaves which show more of her Indica heritage. During flowering the Sativa side of the genetics becomes more evident as she starts stretching and gaining height. Being such a strong hybrid, she is suitable for all sorts of growing techniques, whether you are focused on having numerous plants per m2 or just a handful.

Passion Fruit is ready to harvest after 8-9 weeks indoors. Outdoors she can become huge so make sure you give her enough space to grow. She will be ready outdoors in the middle/end of Autumn.

The genetics used to create Passion Fruit ensure the following characteristics:

A strong and resilient plant which is easy to grow

Hybrid vigour ensures a large plant with big yields which finishes quickly

A truly amazing aroma and taste combined with a powerful high
Passion Fruit is a great plant for beginners as she is quite resilient and forgiving. Although we recommend giving her a stable grow environment in order to optimise her potential, she will still produce decent size plants and potent buds when grown in sub-optimum conditions.


Sweet Pink Grapefruit + Orange Bud = Passion Fruit!
Passion Fruit appeals to anyone needing a feminised seed variety with a seriously powerful high, heavy yields and a genuine fruit-packed taste. Passion Fruit comes from crossing Orange Bud with Sweet Pink Grapefruit. The sweet fruity parent varieties ensure that Passion Fruit packs the fresh taste and fruity aroma that will make your buds stand out from the crowd.

Dutch Passion obtained the superb clone of original Sweet Pink Grapefruit from a trusted friend in Belgium. It was one of the fruitiest varieties the team have encountered in a long time. When sampling the THC rich Sweet Pink Grapefruit buds the Dutch Passion test team were blown away by the smell and taste. The great yields added to the appeal.

The team immediately knew that they had to create a new feminised cannabis seed variety using these genetics. Sweet Pink Grapefruit and Orange Bud are both highly respected cannabis seed varieties in their own right. When hybridised together the result is arguably even better than either of the original parent varieties.

Passion Fruit buds are unmistakably some of the most complex, fruity and tasty that Dutch Passion have encountered in many years. Passion Fruit is an exciting new addition to the Orange family and a great new high-quality cannabis seed variety which you can rely on.


Passion Fruit effects
Passion Fruit is a powerful hybrid with THC levels of around 20%, she is definitely considered a strong variety. We have seen phenotypes of around 25% THC and in some cases THC levels of around 30% THC have been reported, though not yet confirmed by our own lab testing.

These unusually high THC levels show the remarkable genetic potential of this variety. The effect is powerful and cerebral yet not devastating nor paranoid. Passion Fruit will get you as high as a kite, but you will still able to function. We believe the crossing has produced just the right amount of both Indica and Sativa genes.

Original Orange Bud genetics help to keep the high uplifting and social. Be in no doubt, Passion Fruit is exceptionally strong and delivers a superb feel-good high. This is also an excellent variety for the grower seeking exceptional quality THC-rich plants to use as eventual mother plants.

Passion Fruit variety flowering time
We normally recommend a vegetative period of about 4 weeks. When growing in a SOG (sea of green) it is possible to grow this variety on 12/12 light cycle straight after the feminised cannabis seeds have germinated. When you grow just a few plants per m2 we recommend giving her a veg period of about 6 weeks. Being close to a 50/50 hybrid you can expect quite some stretch during flowering, though not as much as ‘pure’ Sativas or Sativa dominant hybrids.

It is possible to use many types of growing techniques like LST (low stress training) as well as HST (high stress training). Passion Fruit reacts very well to them all. Topping or fimming is recommended if you want to make her even bushier or branch out earlier. We do not recommend topping/fimming the Indica dominant phenotype since this will destroy her massive main cola.

Passion Fruit will produce great results outdoors too. Being a variety that can cope with colder temperatures at night this sturdy lady is proven for outdoor growing. Even in mountainous regions where temperatures at night can drop significantly, Passion Fruit has the ability to thrive. Massive plants of 2.5-3.5m tall are possible and they can be just as wide given proper soil, nutrients and sunlight.

Growing her in a greenhouse would be recommended to reach her full potential outdoors. However, consider the need to maintain sufficient fresh air to the greenhouse in order to optimise the final result. Avoid still, stale air in greenhouses as this will increase the possibility of fungus and mold in the numerous dense flowers.

The flowering time is about 8-9 weeks. In combination with the recommended veg phase it takes around 12-15 weeks from seed to harvest.

The yield of Passion Fruit
Passion Fruit produces large harvests of high-quality cannabis. Expect around 500 to 600+ grams per m2 in optimised conditions. The hybrid plants will carry big and bulky flowers.

Our expert advice
Crossing our original Orange Bud with Sweet Pink Grapefruit led to Passion Fruit and we couldn’t be happier with the result as it combines the best of both worlds! It is quite an easy plant to grow but can be challenging to master (in a fun way). This makes it an interesting variety for all types of growers.

Passion Fruit is one of those high quality feminised seed varieties with the potential for some of the highest THC levels and premium quality buds. This makes Passion Fruit an attractive variety for the experienced grower seeking a special harvest. Yet Passion Fruit is a forgiving variety with a wide growing latitude which makes her an option for less experienced growers too.

Be aware of prolonged periods with high humidity levels during flowering, as she can become sensitive to mold. Ensure a proper air flow to reduce the chance of losing those precious connoisseur quality buds.

In terms of robustness, Passion Fruit can handle cold temperatures quite well. Cooler night temperatures can induce some autumnal looking blue/purple hues in the buds and leaves, making her very attractive to look at. This can also increase resin levels making her even more sticky!

Passion Fruit is only available in feminized seeds."

Orange Bud, buds are very sweet with clear citrus tones
Orange Bud is one of the original skunk seed varieties. She was discovered during an extensive Skunk selection grow-out from the early 80’s. The goal back then was to create one of the fruitiest varieties available without comprising either yield or quality. The strain quickly became one of the favorites on the menu of the coffeeshops in the Netherlands. People loved the reliably strong smoke and great citrus skunk taste.

Orange Bud, Power Plant and White Widow were 3 of the original corner stone strains which can still be found in many coffeeshop across The Netherlands. Orange Bud achieved a legendary status for the orange-green buds with fiery orange hairs and aromas of ripe oranges and nectarines.

Orange Bud is covered in sticky resin
Orange Bud is a plant that produces premium quality buds. Even new growers will find Orange Bud seeds easy and pleasurable to grow. She produces generous levels of dense, hard buds covered in crystals and beautiful orange hairs.

Orange Bud is an easy to grow Skunk with a great taste
Orange Bud is a unique Skunk selection. She is a vigorous grower with strong stems and a consistent growth pattern. She is quite forgiving and can handle nutrients very well. This proven cannabis seed variety is easy enough for beginners to grow. During bloom she will stretch to approximately double her height. She is easy to manage and remains a customer favourite for ease of growth and bud quality. Good quality skunk cannabis seeds are easy and straightforward to cultivate, Orange Bud seeds are no exception to this rule.

She is a Sativa dominant cannabis seed variety with the right amount of Indica genes to make her flower quite fast and to keep her height from growing in an uncontrolled manner. Most phenotypes will show that Sativa heritage in the plant and bud structure, the buds can be become long and fully stacked from top to bottom. Others show a more golf-ball type of bud structure which becomes dense and compact. This puts down quite some weight on the scales at harvest.

Give her a little bit more nutrients, or a little less, and she will handle it with minimal drama. Orange Bud cannabis seeds are suitable for both the SOG and SCROG technique.

How to grow Dutch Passion Orange Bud cannabis seeds
Orange Bud is particularly notable for her yields in ‘sea of green’ (SOG) grows. By using this grow method you will be able to achieve the biggest possible harvest. A SOG grow is quite straight forward and less time consuming than most other growing methods. The strain also thrives in a ‘screen of green’ grow (‘SCROG’). She loves being bent, manipulated and super cropped. Be sure to give her a longer VEG period if you grow her in a SCROG setup.

Orange Bud is ready to harvest in around 8-9 weeks indoors. Outdoors she can be relatively fast as well, making her a good candidate for early autumn harvests. It is recommended to select the fastest flowering phenotypes for outdoor growing and keep the longer flowering ones for indoor cultivation.

The genetics used to create Orange Bud ensure the following characteristics :

An easy to grow plant, suitable for all grow mediums and techniques

Fast flowering Sativa dominant Skunk with solid yields

A frosty dense bud structure with orange hairs

Appealing sweet and fruity aroma with a social and uplifting high
Orange bud performs well in the hands of a new grower and she will do great in the hands of an experienced grower. This is a variety that can give bumper harvests without too much hassle.

Orange Bud has a pungent citrus dominant terpene profile
Many repeat growers of Orange Bud cannabis seeds claim the main reason they love her so much is due to the uniquely sweet, citrus skunky terpene profile. The rich scent is appealing and attention grabbing, making you want to squeeze the oily buds and enjoy the penetrating and gloriously enjoyable aroma. These are some of the most powerful, feel-good buds you will have ever enjoyed smoking/vaping. The great scent of juicy, freshly picked nectarines is one you will never forget.

Orange Bud effects
Orange Bud is known for its active, social cerebral high. It gives the smoker a feel-good high which is very happy and uplifting. It is a strong variety with THC levels of around 15-20%. The strain is good for stoners with active lifestyles. It will get you through the day or evening. Slightly energising, the citrus terpene profile tastes great and leaves you with a smile on your face.

Orange Bud strain flowering time
We normally recommend a vegetative period of about 4-6 weeks. Being a Sativa dominant hybrid she roughly doubles in size during flowering. When growing in a SOG it is possible to grow this variety on 12/12 from seed or after one week of growth. When you grow just a few plants per m2 we recommend giving her a veg period of about 6 weeks.

When grown in a SCROG with a single plant we recommend giving her about 8 weeks of growth. This will ensure a massive plant that is able to carry numerous branches of thick and long buds for a bountiful harvest.

Orange Bud can be grown outdoors too, its relatively faster flowering period and small amount of leaves in the buds makes it suitable for outdoor growing. There is less chance of dead leaves due to the high-calyx leaf ratio reducing the risk of bud rot.

For best results, give Orange Bud some high-quality organic soil and a location with a gentle, light prevailing wind. This will make her stronger and more resistant to periods of bad weather. She is known to produce even frostier buds outdoors than indoors because of the lower temperatures which increase trichome density.

The flowering time is about 8-9 weeks. In combination with the recommended veg phase it takes around 12-14 weeks from seed to harvest.

The yield of Dutch Passion Orange Bud
Orange Bud produces large harvests of high-quality cannabis; around 400 to 450+ grams per m2 on average. More is possible when the SOG method is used to perfection.

Our expert advice when growing Orange Bud seeds
Orange Bud remains a firm favourite with self-sufficient growers. She combines all the important aspects of a successful strain for home-growers. She is a vigorous plant, not a fussy feeder at all. Yields are heavy, Orange Bud weed is strong with a great taste and an uplifting feel-good high. Most importantly it’s an easy variety to grow, one of the varieties we would recommend to a new or inexperienced grower.

Try growing Orange Bud in a SOG setup, this is where she really thrives. The plants double in size during flowering so make sure to plan accordingly. You will not need very long VEG periods if you grow her in a SOG. If you want to keep her very compact and bushy make sure not to give her more than a week of VEG growth and grow her in the same size container from the start, between 4-11L pots will be enough for decent sized plants.

The Ultimate,"Why should I buy The Ultimate feminised seeds?
The Ultimate is a balanced hybrid with a super fat yield

This variety is easy to grow and suitable even for beginners, with truly epic yields in the hands of an expert

The Ultimate has mega-sized flowers. The plant remains medium in size but the buds are XXL-sized. The aroma is pungent with spicy notes of pine, lemon and gasoline

This classic cannabis variety is suitable for any growing method and grow medium. With proper care and attention this strain will produce dense blooms as long as your arm
The Ultimate has a pungent scent with piney, spicy and fruity notes
The Ultimate has a strong, pungent aroma. During flowering the aroma changes several times and towards the end of the flowering she has a spicy and pungent scent of pine, petrol and citrus fruit. The aroma can sometimes be slightly more fruity and sweet, but this only occurs with a few phenotypes. During the last 4 weeks the smell becomes stronger and therefore it is recommended to use good carbon filters. The dried bud can sometimes smell a bit more earthy and spicy, but as soon as you break it open or grind it, the more fruity and piney aroma will come your way. The taste is comparable to the smell; spicy, fruity and quite Skunky with occasional sweeter notes.

The Ultimate is one of the highest yielding strains available
The Ultimate is one of the highest yielding cannabis strains ever created. She is a balanced 50% Indica / 50% Sativa variety with an excellent reputation for easy and large yields. It is a customer favourite due to the extremely high yield and robust growth. The blooms are known for being long and thick. This strain produces massive blooms that can easily grow as thick as your forearm. The leaves are a nice dark green and the buds are a lighter green color, full of foxtails and orange hairs. The buds actually look beautiful and are rich in trichomes. The combination of these sticky white buds and bright orange hairs will remind many growers of the best old school Skunk varieties from the past.

What kind of genetics are there exactly in The Ultimate?
Through careful breeding we have developed one of our best varieties. We called her ""The Ultimate"". The Ultimate combines a very high yield with professional quality. The original parents have remained a secret because we wanted The Ultimate to be recognised as a variety in her own right. What we can say is that she is very much like a strong, easy to grow Skunk that usually combines big yields with high potency. Her buds can have a Sativa appearance but become much fuller and thicker than those of the average Sativa strain. Few strains can match this classic cannabis strain from Dutch Passion!

The Ultimate is a strong hybrid cannabis plant with very long heavy flowers and an XXL yield
The Ultimate is a powerful balanced hybrid cannabis variety. Our seed breeders have worked hard to give this stable hybrid the highest possible yield. This strain has a normal growth rate, it is mainly the final size and weight of the buds that makes the difference.

During the flowering phase, the plants have a medium-to-high stretch. During this period of stretching the plants will grow vertically as well as in width. The Ultimate is known as a light feeder and with sufficient light and perfect growing conditions she can grow into a beautiful cannabis plant completely filled from top to bottom with sturdy long buds. This stretch lasts an average of 3 weeks after the clock changed to 12/12 bloom lighting. From the moment stretch stops, the bloom development begins. At the same time the production of the trichomes starts and continues at a rapid pace.

During the last 4 weeks of the flowering phase, bud production will go into the next gear and you will see the flowers swell into incredibly long and heavy ‘colas’. The buds get hard and compact, this variety likes high light levels during the flowering phase. It is best to support the tops by means of a net or with supporting cord, so that they don’t sag under their own weight. This 50/50 Indica/Sativa is a truly beautiful strain. She is the strain of choice for those looking for a balanced hybrid with mega-sized buds. Beyond her size, she is very tolerant of nutrition and temperature changes, making her suitable for novice growers as well. However, humidity in bloom should be kept low (<50% at all times) to prevent mold and bud rot.

The genetics used for The Ultimate guarantee the following properties:

A potent cannabis hybrid with moderate stretching during the flowering phase
An XXL yield with extremely large buds that require some support during the flowering phase
The potent flowers have a pungent aroma of pine and lime combined with more sweet and earthy notes
The Ultimate is the ideal strain for growers looking for the highest yield possible.

Effects of The Ultimate
The Ultimate has a strong, potent high. Many users experience a powerful high that hits quickly and lasts for a long time. For people with a low tolerance, it is useful to know that this is a strong high that becomes more intense the more you smoke. Are you new/inexperienced with cannabis? Then vape / smoke this variety at your leisure and have a short pause during smoking to allow the high to take full effect.

It is usually a very calming, uplifting ""up-high"" with a strong anti-anxiety effect. It can also contain a creative element that feels energetic and peaceful at the same time. It is a good strain for smoke sessions with friends because you can just relax without feeling trippy or anxious. As a result, The Ultimate is also highly appreciated by many medical users. She is also known as a strain that can numb that pain, probably due to her partial Indica heritage and exceptional terpene profile.

The flowering time of The Ultimate
Flowering time takes an average of 9 weeks, with explosive bloom development over the last 2-3 weeks. The Ultimate absorbs many nutrients during the growth cycle and can handle a high light intensity during the flowering phase, this benefits the final yield. The Ultimate is a medium sized plant that normally grows to around 0.75m-1m, and in some cases even a bit taller. She produces very thick flowers on side branches and the main cola.

Experienced growers will appreciate the exceptional bloom power during the late weeks of flowering. This strain produces a lot of white pistils, even until the end of the flowering phase. In the most favourable conditions, she needs about 9 weeks of 12/12 indoor light to mature. It is best harvested when the trichomes are mainly cloudy.

The yield from The Ultimate
The Ultimate has a heavy harvest and grows to an average of around 75cm, ideal for indoor cultivation. This strain is known for her very generous yields in almost all types of growing conditions. Yields of around 500-600g/m2 are easy to achieve.

She grows well in soil, coco and on a hydro system. She does very well in a SCROG grow and is able to produce XXL yields of well over 600g/m2. Even with a single plant of this strain, you can achieve more than 750g/m2 with the right knowledge, care and growing conditions. However, this is only reserved for the most experienced growers who also work with the best lamps, growing systems, nutrition and other cultivation products.

Outdoors she becomes very large and can carry several kilos per plant. The Ultimate does well in controlled greenhouses and in warm dry climates where the risk of mold is much less. In a temperate / cold climate you might be better off growing the autoflower version of The Ultimate called Auto Ultimate.

Advice from our experts
An important tip when growing The Ultimate is not to start flushing too early and certainly not to harvest it too early. This variety rewards the grower's patience with an extra fat yield! We also recommend using a dehumidifier during the flowering phase, because the buds will become so thick and compact that you want to give mold as little chance as possible!

If you want to get the most out of this lady, try growing her in a SCROG (Screen of Green). If you prefer low-stress training you can bend her during the growth phase and secure with garden cord to allow her to grow more in width. Either method will ensure that all buds will receive an equal amount of light and that will enable you to achieve an epic yield!

Information about The Ultimate
The Ultimate is one of the most appreciated varieties in our collection. In terms of yield, she is without a doubt one of the best yielding plants in our collection. Only Power Plant and Amsterdam Amnesia can come close to this XXL yield. Besides the great yield, she is also easy to clone and very potent, so we cannot recommend this strain highly enough!"

Orange, mandarin and lemon are the 3 most common scents and flavors.

With some phenotypes, the Kush background of this strain can come to the surface. This results in more berry and earthy flavors, both on the inhale & exhale.

Critical Orange Punch is easy to grow and has a high yield
This lady can take a beating. She is a strain that is suitable for beginners and will provide you with a delicious and heavy yield without too much effort! The plants thrive in all types of grow rooms and grow methods. She will flourish in a SOG and SCROG just as well as when she is left to grow naturally. Snapping and bending branches works well to create a more even foliage. A canopy of buds, where all buds receive approximately the same maximum light intensity, ensures the highest yield.

What kind of genetics does Critical Orange Punch contain?
This variety is a feminised photoperiod cannabis strain and the first Dutch Passion variety based on the excellent Kritikal Bilbo genetics from Spain. The breeding began by crossing elite cuttings of Grandaddy Purple and Orange Bud (producing ‘Orange Punch’). The result was a great taste experience but with below average yields. This strain was then crossed with a high yielding THC-rich Critical. This has significantly improved yields thanks to the vigour of the Critical parent.

Critical Orange Punch has thick compact buds that provide a good yield relatively quickly
Critical Orange Punch is a true hybrid cannabis plant. It is bigger than most Indica dominant plants and smaller than most Sativas. The hybrid structure ensures strong plants with large, heavy blooms and a relatively short flowering time.

During the beginning of the growth phase she can have a more Indica dominant look. But as time goes by she develops sturdy thick branches and leaves which show a true hybrid structure. This strain is suitable for the use of all kinds of growing techniques, such as LST, topping, fimming etc. She does well on soil but also does very well on hydro. This is a forgiving plant that can take a beating. Also try growing her completely organically, this will benefit her complex aroma and taste!

During the flowering phase the plants will stretch somewhat. Her internodal distance is medium which allows for a little more space between her round golf ball-like buds. At the beginning of the flowering phase, a lot of hairs develop in the blooms laying the foundation for the thick and compact flowers that will form afterwards.

The plant structure is best described as medium to large. The internode distance is also medium and the leaves are of a hybrid structure that will tend towards a 50/50 hybrid. Not thick leaves, not narrow, somewhere in between. She does well in both SOG and SCROG cultivation, actually nothing is too difficult for her. Even with 1 plant per m2 you can achieve great yields.

The genetics used for Critical Orange Punch guarantee the following properties:

A medium sized plant with sturdy stems and dense, tasty buds.
An easy-to-grow plant, suitable for beginners.
Penetrating, fruity and earthy aromas with a high yield.
Critical Orange Punch is ideal for beginners. It is easy to manage and does not require any special feeding schedules or growing techniques.
Effects of Critical Orange Punch
This hybrid cannabis strain guarantees a pleasant, relaxing effect. Most users experience a happy, energetic and relaxed feeling. Especially with the more Sativa leaning phenotypes, expect a particularly euphoric and uplifting high. Critical Orange Punch is a good daytime smoke given the hybrid effect of the high. Some users experience a strong ""body stone"" in the more Indica dominant phenotypes. These often smell and taste a bit more earthy/hash-like and a little less fruity. This is the more Kush-dominant phenotype.

The flowering time of Critical Orange Punch
Critical Orange Punch is a fast bloomer for a hybrid cannabis strain. On average, the flowering phase lasts about 8 weeks. This can differ according to the phenotype and can be a week faster or slower. Unfavourable growing conditions can cause delays, as is the case with all cannabis varieties.

The strain will continue to grow for about 2-3 weeks during the flowering phase, with most stretching in the first week of 12/12. The buds start to appear from the 2nd week. After about 3-4 weeks the plants are full of white flower hairs and the production of the buds can finally start!

The yield of Critical Orange Punch
Critical Orange Punch produces a high yield in a short period of time. Its XXL marking indicates that, in the right hands, this plant can ensure an incredibly good end result. Look for the most hybrid looking plants, these are the plants with the highest yield due to the larger heavy buds. On average, yields of 500-600g/m2 are possible. In the right hands and in the best conditions it is possible to exceed 600g/m2. However, this is only for the more experienced and dedicated growers.

Outdoors she can be very big and productive with yields up to 1-2 kg per plant. This only applies to growers with sufficient, good quality soil and ample sunshine each day. To achieve this yield, the plant will grow into a round bushy cannabis plant about 2.5-3m high with roughly the same width. She also does well in smaller pots and can yield hundreds of grams per plant. For the best result, she is best grown in a Mediterranean climate or in a moderate climate with a good late summer.

Advice from our experts
Do you want to achieve the highest possible yield in your grow tent? Then we recommend giving her a try in a SCROG culture. With this growing method you can achieve extremely high yields. We recommend defoliating her several times and removing lower branches, so that more fresh air comes through the dense foliage. This ensures a constant, fresh supply of both oxygen and CO2, important building blocks for a healthy plant and high yield.

Information about Critical Orange Punch
Critical Orange Punch is a robust and strong cannabis plant. She has incredibly fruity and sticky buds that are strong smelling and may show some appealing colours during late bloom. When subjected to cold temperatures during late flowering she will develop beautiful dark, sometimes purple, hues on the leaves. This makes her a beautiful plant to behold."

White Widow is a medium sized plant with compact, high potency, all-white buds
White Widow is a medium sized hybrid cannabis variety with very compact buds. The buds typically produce fewer orange coloured pistils than most cannabis strains. It is the excellent resin production that has made this strain so famous, it can be seen even on the larger fan leaves. White Widow owes its name to this extremely high resin production with its exceptionally thick white layer of trichomes.

White Widow is not a difficult plant to grow. With the right environment and care, she will grow into a beautiful plant that will richly reward you with a good harvest. She is suitable for any type of grow, but thrives best in a controlled indoor grow. The branches are strong enough to bend / snap or ""scrog"". White Widow has a medium internode distance and her buds have a very favourable flower-to-leaf ratio. Large buds are only surrounded by small leaves that are easy and quick to remove, which significantly increases the speed of cutting/trimming.

White Widow has average stretch for a hybrid cannabis plant. She continues to grow in the flowering phase for around 2.5 to 3 weeks. Plants are known for their vigorous growth and beautiful full buds packed with glittering trichomes. Trichome production starts quite early in flowering and continues at a rapid pace. It's no coincidence that this strain is still considered one of the strongest and most potent cannabis strains. Due to its high potency, it is appreciated by both medical and recreational users all over the world.

The genetics used for White Widow guarantee the following properties:

A compact/medium sized plant with strong branches and full flowers
Thick hard buds with a favourable flower-to-leaf ratio
Extremely white buds with a very high THC content
White Widow is the ideal strain for enthusiasts and connoisseurs of old school genetics and incredibly potent, sticky bud.

Effects of White Widow
The extremely white buds of our White Widow warn of the powerful effects that will follow. The effects are known for being strong and long-lasting. Many smokers report experiencing an initial euphoric high that is very energetic, ideal for creative tasks. As the high progresses and you consume more, it transforms into a more narcotic and relaxing effect. The high has a strong energetic peak in the beginning but is followed by a soothing feeling. Ideal for falling asleep after watching a long movie, for example.

The flowering time of White Widow
White Widow flowers for an average of 8-9 weeks, making it one of the faster flowering Indica dominant hybrid cannabis plants. In good conditions it will be harvest-ready within 8 weeks.

The plants will stretch quite a bit after switching the clock to 12/12. During the flowering phase, the leaves become a bit slimmer and the branches become a little longer and thicker.

Within about 3 weeks the growth/stretch rate will slow down considerably and will come to a halt. At the same time as the flower hairs develop, resin production starts on the smallest leaves (""sugar leaves”). About a month later the buds will be completely covered in a THC-rich, sticky blanket of trichomes.

The yield of White Widow
White Widow is a fast bloomer with a good yield. This means that you can achieve a high yield within a short period of time. This XL cannabis strain is not the biggest in size, but it does get full, long buds that can get incredibly compact. On average, yields of around 400-500 g/m2 are possible. And this within just 8 weeks!

She is known for her compact, full buds with a good 'calyx-to-leaf' ratio. This means that her buds will only have small leaves in them. Manicuring these buds is incredibly easy and quick. This is a plant that grows well in both a SOG and a SCROG or in the natural way, nothing is too crazy for her.

Outdoors she will thrive in drier climates, but her fast flowering time makes her suitable for growing in temperate climates as well. Be careful towards the end of the flowering phase, because high humidity increases the risk of bud rot and mold.

Advice from our experts
Overall, White Widow is an uncomplicated strain that requires little or no advice. This strain practically grows by itself! What we can recommend to promote her potency and stickiness is to put her completely in the dark during the last 3 days of the flowering phase (0 hours light / 24 hours dark). During this time the plant will stress a bit and produce even more trichomes.

Another tip for the more professional grower is to reduce the light cycle during the last 2 weeks of flowering from 12 hours of light per day to 10 hours of light per day (10 hours light / 14 hours dark). This ensures more resin and trichomes. It also means that the second internode bloom (not visible in all phenotypes) is stopped. This will result in fewer new foxtails.

Information about White Widow
White Widow has a reputation for being one of the strongest strains ever created. Our producers have worked hard to optimise this potent, vigorous variety and then stabilise the best traits. The result is this legendary and highly sought-after variety of excellent quality with thick buds, white from the crystals. Dutch Passion's White Widow is very consistent and easy to grow in any medium. The quality and consistency is particularly pronounced in this feminized version, which has become a bestseller and a standard that other seed companies strive to match."

Mokum's Tulip has a sweet, fruity and creamy character, honouring the Gelato genetics
Mokum's Tulip is a typical Gelato hybrid. Her aroma is pungent and best described as very sweet, creamy and fruity. This aroma and flavor explosion comes from a unique terpene profile that really makes the buds smell and taste like ice cream. Either forest fruit ice cream or more of a grapefruit / orange-like ice cream flavour. There is something for everyone. Those who like a true Gelato variety will certainly enjoy our Mokum's Tulip. This strain smokes and tastes exactly as it smells, very tasty!

Mokum's Tulip is a robust grower and fast bloomer
Mokum’s Tulip grows fast and flowers quickly. In general, the plants develop sturdy and thick trunks/branches, which makes her extremely suitable for a SOG setup or for growing in the natural way. The compact and heavy buds are well supported by these thick branches. In the right conditions, phenotypes can be found that are ready in a maximum of 7-8 weeks. But in general we recommend a flowering time of between 56-63 days.

What kind of genetics are there in Mokum's Tulip?
The Head of Genetics for Dutch Passion came across a very special Gelato phenotype on one of his travels. The plant had a special sweet scent and beautiful blue tones in the leaves. The glittering buds were rock hard, and the Head of Genetics was surprised by the rich flavor that matched the sweet, appealing aroma of the flowering plant. He immediately knew that these genetics would form a good basis for yet another exceptional Dutch Passion cross.

When this Gelato pheno arrived in Mokum (an old name for Amsterdam), it was crossed with a powerful Sherbet cutting, which leaned towards the sweet side of the Cookie family. The Sherbet has a rich terpene profile, generous yields and a very powerful high.

Mokum's Tulip has very compact and sticky buds with a good flower-leaf ratio
Mokum's Tulip is a world-class feminised hybrid. The strong growth pattern combines with her sturdy and robust plant structure to ensure that the thick buds can develop quickly and well. It does this just inside 8 weeks! Most plants show a hybrid character in terms of plant/bloom structure that will lean slightly towards the Indica side. She is compact, with wide leaves, thick branches and round flowers.

We recommend that you do not defoliate her too much and certainly not crack and/or bend her. The strong branches can make it more difficult to use certain growing techniques such as LST (Low Stress Training) or HST (High Stress Training). We generally strongly advise against 'Supercropping', only the most experienced growers would dare to try this. Due to her strong stature she is easy to grow and it is not necessary for beginners to master advanced grow techniques before cultivating this strain.

During the flowering phase, the plants show an average stretch for a hybrid. Her internode distance is short to medium. Flowering hairs (pistils) develop quickly after turning the clock to 12/12 bloom lighting conditions. Her buds will usually be nice, round and very compact. The slightly larger and longer flowering plants show buds with slightly more Sativa characteristics and a very favourable flower-leaf ratio. In general, all phenotypes can be cut easily and quickly. Make sure to use gloves when cutting because all buds are packed with resin and are really sticky!

The genetics used for Mokum's Tulip guarantee the following properties:

A medium sized plant with sturdy stems and compact buds.
A wonderfully fruity and sweet Gelato aroma and taste.
Beautiful buds with a very high THC content and a rich terpene profile.
Mokum's Tulip is the perfect connoisseur strain. She actually smells and tastes like ice cream!

The flowering time of Mokum's Tulip
Mokum's Tulip is a fast bloomer, with an average flowering time of about 8 weeks. This can differ from one phenotype to another. There are phenotypes that are 1 week faster and others which require 1 week longer. View the trichomes with a microscope at the end of bloom to make sure they are fully ripe and have the correct ratio of milky, cloudy & amber trichomes.

The strain will grow for about 2.5 weeks during the flowering phase with the most stretching in the first and second week of 12/12. The flower hairs start to appear from the 2nd week of flowering. After around 4 weeks the plants are full of round white buds, from this point onwards the plants mainly focus on the development of these buds.

The yield from Mokum's Tulip
Mokum's Tulip produces a high yield in combination with a very short flowering time. Due to its compactness it is possible to achieve large yields, though the buds may be slightly smaller than the largest yielding plants in our collection. However, in the right hands and the right grow environment, she can ensure an XL yield of the highest quality!

On average, yields of between 400-500g/m2 are possible. She does well in a SOG setup with many plants per m2 in slightly smaller pots (12L), but also with fewer plants per m2 in large pots (25-30L) and a longer growth phase.

Outdoors she grows into a sturdy, bushy plant that can support quite a bit of weight. The most important tip we can give for outdoor cultivation is to watch out for very high humidity due to the compactness of the buds. She does best in drier and warm climates where you will be able to smell the pungent aroma from a distance.

Advice from our experts
Mokum's Tulip is a plant that has quickly become very popular in the grower community for its pungent aroma and excellent taste that the buds produce. If you want to maximise the quality of your results then we recommend using the ‘Blue Light Treatment’ during the end of the flowering phase for an even higher production of terpenes.

Another option is to leave the plants in the dark for a maximum of 2-3 days at the end of the flowering phase to give them a little more stress. This will make them even more resinous and tacky! Do not forget to water them. Even though the light is turned off, they still consume water every day.

Information about Mokum's Tulip
Amsterdam has long been known for its tulips. The scent of this new creation reminded the Dutch Passion team of a sweet, red rose. Hence the name “Mokum's Tulip”. This XL yielding variety is a must for your empty Cookie jar!"

Glueberry OG effects
Glueberry OG is a crossing from a mix of Indica and Sativa dominant strains. The effects of Indica strains are very relaxing, providing a heavy body relaxation. While the Sativa effects are more uplifting and give a strong psychoactive cerebral high. In comparison to the Blueberry strain, Glueberry OG has a stronger effect and is a little less sweet.

The growth and flowering time of the Glueberry OG
We recommend a veg period of 3-4weeks for these seeds. Glueberry is not the fastest in growth but it is a very strong plant. Glueberry OG grows under a wide range of conditions, so it is suitable for less experienced growers.

Glueberry OG reaches an average height of around 1-1.5m. It’s a connoisseur variety for home growing with XL yields of powerful THC rich buds. The flowering time is 8 weeks. In combination with the recommended veg phase, it will take around 12 weeks from seed to harvest.

More info about Glueberry OG
Glueberry OG also performs well when grown in a SCROG environment, if this is your preferred growing method then you may wish to allow extra time during veg growth to really fill the net. Some growers would consider 5-6 weeks a suitable period, more if it’s a bigger SCROG.

Experienced growers should note that Glueberry OG really responds well to intense lighting during bloom. Side lighting also helps this variety deliver XL yields. If you have a UVB light try using this for the last 2-3 weeks for a few hours each day, and watch the trichomes increase in number and density. LED growers will see great results in bloom.

Glueberry OG is a popular variety with concentrate producers and lovers of cannabis oil, BHO, shatter, rosin, hash and other types of cannabis extracts. The high oil/resin content from these genetics make this a popular repeat buy for these looking to maximise their concentrate yields.

One final tip from the breeder. If you like a really strong and heavy body stone from this variety leave her an extra week or two in bloom for extra amber trichomes. This produces a powerful couch lock effect which can be great for a night at home.

The master growers of Dutch Passion have crossed these two magnificent strains with each other and crossed the result with our longtime classic Blueberry. The outcome of this beautiful cross with XL yields and an average height of 1.5 m is called Glueberry OG and we are proud to have a new addition to our USA Special line."
Banana Blaze,"Why should I buy Banana Blaze feminized seeds?
She is an easy to grow feminized photoperiod cannabis strain.
It is a strong plant with which you can also achieve good yields without the use of complicated growing techniques.
Banana Blaze is a compact Indica dominant hybrid with a relatively short flowering time of 8 weeks on average.
She has a fruity and unique terpene profile that tastes like bananas. This is one strain that is definitely worth a try!
Banana Blaze has a sweet, fruity and creamy banana aroma
Banana Blaze is full of buds with a delicious aroma at harvest. Most plants have a sweet and fruity character, often with the aroma and taste of a banana. These are the tastiest and most delicious phenotypes! There are also phenotypes that have slightly more pine-like and floral notes. In general, the aroma profile can best be described as creamy, fruity and musky. A distinct warm, fruity and sensual mix of terpenes.

Banana Blaze has sticky buds that grow large and heavy
This banana Indica is an Indica dominant hybrid with thick, full buds. The flowers become very sticky at the beginning of the flowering phase when they are only producing white hairs. These large round bulbs eventually grow into large buds that will be quite heavy. Give her enough attention and love and she will reward you with a great yield!

What kind of genetics are in Banana Blaze?
The special genetics come from a great Banana Indica from the Dutch Passion gene bank from the 1990’s. We had saved this “old school” banana Indica for a special development program such as this. The team was very impressed with the terpene profile of this banana Indica.

Banana Blaze has tasty compact buds that provide a good yield
Banana Blaze is an Indica dominant strain with a compact plant and bud structure. She is selected for her unique flavor profile and high yield. She belongs to our Afghani Kush family because of her genetic background. A true Indica born from the same regions as the legendary cup-winning Mazar and Master Kush varieties.

She is a compact plant which thrives without the use of complicated growth techniques or methods. This makes her perfect for beginners who have never cultivated a cannabis plant before. Growing her naturally, without complicated growth techniques has its advantages. There is less risk of things going wrong and this is ideal for novice growers. They can then focus on the most important things, such as fine-tuning the climate, light, water and food. This plant practically grows herself.

This strain will stretch a little more in bloom than most Indica dominant strains in our collection, such as Bubba Island Kush or Night Queen. Her central 'main cola' can grow into a bloom of epic proportions in the right conditions. A dry weight of 15-30 g for the main bloom is the rule rather than the exception.

Her plant structure can best be described as compact to medium. The internode distance is relatively short and the leaves are of a hybrid structure that lean towards the Indica side - thicker and wider. This feature also makes her less suitable for growing in a SCROG setup.

The genetics used for Banana Blaze guarantee the following properties:

A compact plant with sturdy branches and thick leaves.
An easy-to-grow plant suitable for beginners who want to grow great tasting cannabis without too much effort.
Beautiful chunky and heavy buds that smell wonderfully strong.
Banana Blaze is a great strain for the novice grower. She is easy to control and doesn’t require any special nutrition or growing methods.
Effects of Banana Blaze
This Indica-dominant variety gives you a great, relaxing body stone. It is clearly noticeable that this strain consists mainly of Indica genes. Expect a wonderfully relaxed feeling during (and after!) smoking/vaping this strain. The effect is mainly physical with a slight mental buzz. Ideal for hanging out on the couch or relaxing after a busy long day. A small bud is enough for a thick joint because the buds are so compact!

The flowering time of Banana Blaze
Banana Blaze is a fast bloomer. Normally, the flowering phase lasts an average of 8 weeks. However, there are phenotypes that are a week faster or a week slower. So in general the flowering time will be between 7 and 9 weeks. Unfavourable or non-optimised conditions can, as always, cause delays.

She stretches during the first 2.5 weeks of flowering, maximum 3 weeks. The plants can roughly double in size and the growth is steady, without excessive jumps. After 3 weeks the buds are full of white hairs and the next phase can begin!

The yield of Banana Blaze
Banana Blaze has a high yield in a relatively short period of time. The most hybrid-looking plants are those with the highest yield. The most Indica dominant plants are the most compact plants. These may have a little less yield, but a faster flowering time. Especially for a SOG setup, these Indica dominant plants are the ones to look for. They are ready quickly with a nice thick compact bloom, easy to grow and quick to cut.

When grown well, Banana Blaze will give heavy yields due to her numerous heavy yielding side branches. If grown naturally she can have a Christmas tree structure, with sturdy flowers and a great yield!

On average, yields of 400-450g/m2 are possible. Outdoors, she will grow to about 2 to 2.5 meters tall and can effortlessly yield up to 500-1000 grams per plant. She can be grown outdoors in any climate, but beware of long moist periods near the end of bloom. Due to the size of the buds they are more susceptible to mold.

Advice from our experts
If you treat this lady lovingly, she really will reward you. We do not recommend cracking and bending branches as they can break rather quickly. Her branches are very stiff and strong, which makes cracking more difficult and is only recommended for the most experienced growers. It is best to grow Banana Blaze naturally or in a SOG setup.

Be careful with a humid climate. Try growing her indoors in a dry climate, maximum 50% humidity, but preferably lower. We also recommend that you ensure sufficient air movement. This minimises the chance of mold and bud rot.

In terms of nutrients, Banana Blaze does not require any special or complicated feeding schedules. For the best and tastiest result, we recommend growing her completely organically.

Information about Banana Blaze
Banana Blaze is a forgiving plant, she can take a beating. Don't make the grow too difficult, feel free to let the plants grow naturally. Defoliating a little at the end of the vegetative growth phase and in the flowering phase (when the stretch is over) can have a positive effect on the yield. This is because the side branches catch a little more light following defoliation. In any case, this delicious variety doesn't need a lot of attention to achieve her full XL potential!"
Strawberry Cough,"Why should I buy Strawberry Cough feminised seeds?
Amazing taste of fresh strawberries

A manageable sativa which is easy to grow

A unique, deliciously euphoric sativa high which is clear, social and energetic

Suitable for all grow techniques and mediums
Strawberry Cough buds are beautiful and very tasty
Strawberry Cough genetics have an almost mythical origin and a unique, highly sought-after effect. The legendary genetics are partly North American and partly European. She is a hybrid cannabis strain which leans more to the Sativa side. The plants are beautiful to look at, some special phenotypes display purple hues in the buds and these are our favorites. Decades after introduction, Strawberry Cough feminised seeds remain a firm favourite with connoisseur repeat growers and staff. The fresh smell and sweet taste of strawberries is sure to leave a smile on your face.

Strawberry Cough is full of terpenes
Strawberry Cough has flowers which are covered in trichomes with occasional reddish pistils and colourful purple/pinkish hues in the flower and leaves. The aroma is unmistakably that of garden-fresh strawberries. The appealing scent may also have a real candy sweetness too. Some phenotypes may express more of a peppery, spicy profile with a milder strawberry scent. These are also a real delight to smoke/vape.

The initial taste is that of ripe strawberries. On the exhale, the flavor has more of a sweeter taste with only a hint of spice. The strawberry scented smoke from this variety can be thick and rich making you cough, hence the name.

Strawberry Cough exhibits an especially rich and flavoursome range of terpenes that any cannabis connoisseur will simply adore. A well cured jar of potent, resin soaked Strawberry Cough buds is difficult to beat! Few hybrid strains can match the combination of beautiful aroma and great visual appearance with such powerful and long-lasting blissful effects.

Dutch Passion Strawberry Cough: An easy to grow Sativa with a great high
Strawberry Cough is a relatively easy strain to grow, especially when compared to other Sativa dominant varieties. It’s not as tall/stretchy as some Sativas like Silver Haze, Amnesia Haze or Desfrán. But the THC-rich Strawberry Cough genetics deliver you the same supremely satisfying smoke/vape quality as that from pure Sativas.

The high is very cerebral. It’s strongly psychoactive, clear, social and euphoric. Both medical and recreational users comment that Strawberry Cough is a uniquely creative strain. This sharp focus is ideal for working on tasks that involve some degree of creativity or problem-solving.

Sativa lovers know that their long flowering plants may sometimes require a little more attention than fast finishing Indica’s. In addition to the longer grow cycle, some Sativa’s can be more sensitive to nutrients making them perhaps a little trickier for beginners. However, experienced sativa growers know that the genetics are well worth the extra effort and bloom time.

That’s because a well grown Sativa can give you a soaring psychedelic high like no other. In the case of Strawberry Cough, you can expect a powerful yet blissfully enjoyable experience from proven genetics which have been adored for decades. These are top quality feminised cannabis seeds with a fully deserved reputation.

Dutch Passion Strawberry Cough has just the right amount of Indica content to make her less fussy with nutrients and also to help control stretch. This makes her more manageable in the grow-room and easier for indoor growers. The plants tend to be a little shorter and bushy than most Sativa’s. She grows to a medium height but still retains the most important characteristics for growers who prefer Sativa’s.

Strawberry Cough strain info: A popular Sativa for beginners
Strawberry Cough’s ongoing popularity has been fuelled by experiences of growers and smokers around the world. This powerful hybrid strain has a particularly loyal fanbase of repeat growers that simply adore the special high.

Many growers are attracted by the legendary name and cult reputation of Strawberry Cough. The Dutch Passion team think that the taste and superb high are the main reasons that the strain has gained such global popularity.

However, there is another reason why Strawberry Cough deserves its place as one of the most iconic sativa strains of all time and that is the ease of growth. Most of those that grow Indicas or Indica-dominant hybrids do so for good reasons. The best ones are easy to grow and they can be quite unfussy even when grown slightly outside their normal conditions or nutrient range.

Indicas or Indica-dominant hybrids grow well under a wide range of conditions and may even tolerate unstable conditions. Strawberry Cough may be a sativa dominant hybrid, but she has a notable robustness similar to indica dominant hybrids.

Strawberry Cough grows relatively quickly like a hybrid, although without a great deal of stretch. The leaves show some hybrid traits as well. However in flowering the leaves become thinner and longer, showing more of the Sativa characteristics.

The buds show a mix of Sativa and Indica genes. The buds are cone shaped, the blooms are long and compact making her easy to trim. Although the high is very Sativa-like, the buds are less fluffy and prone to fox-tailing than you might expect. There are definitely some phenotypes that are prone to fox-tailing but even these buds can be quite dense and compact.

The genetics used to create Strawberry Cough ensure the following traits :

A hybrid leaf and plant structure which leans slightly more to the Sativa side

A solid and sturdy plant that can be grown in both SOG and SCROG setups

Cone shaped Sativa style buds that are dense and compact

Amazing trichome production, loaded with terpenes and THC
Strawberry Cough is a forgiving plant which can be grown by beginners looking to grow their first Sativa dominant variety. She is also an excellent choice for connoisseurs seeking the legendary Strawberry Cough experience!

Strawberry Cough effects
Strawberry Cough is known for its beneficial effects which boost energy and creativity whilst relieving stress and anxiety. The anti-anxiety effect is one the main reasons she is so widely appreciated by the medical cannabis community.

It can also give the user a deep sense of euphoria and focus, making this a good strain to work on everyday tasks or to complete creative and artistic jobs. Strawberry Cough provides the user with a high which will last for several hours. Perfect for a daytime boost or a social evening with friends and family.

Strawberry Cough strain flowering time
We would recommend a vegetative period of around 5-6 weeks. Although she is a Sativa dominant hybrid, she doesn’t stretch as much as pure Sativa varieties. She grows into plants of medium height.

Strawberry Cough is not suitable for outdoor growing in colder climates. Outdoors she can take around 9-11 weeks to harvest making her susceptible to mould and fungus during long periods of bad weather. Growing in a Mediterranean climate should be possible but for the best results we recommend growing her indoors.

The flowering time is about 9-10 weeks. In combination with the recommend veg period she takes about 14-16 weeks from seed to harvest.

The yield of Strawberry Cough
Strawberry Cough will give medium to large yields; around 400 grams per m2 on average. More is possible when you optimise grow conditions.

Our expert advice
Strawberry Cough is still one of the best Sativa cannabis seed varieties available today. She hits all the right notes for an uncomplicated grow. This makes her perfect for beginners. Growing her in a SOG or SCROG setup will definitely give the best yield. Her stems can be bent and supercropped to increase yields even more.

If you want to keep an even canopy we highly recommend supercropping techniques. She is also a good plant to grow the natural way, her stems are strong enough to prevent her collapsing under the weight of her own blooms.

More info about Strawberry Cough

One of the fruitiest strains on the planet

Still a customer favourite ever since its introduction in the late 90’s
Original Blueberry multiple prize winner
Blueberry has won numerous awards during the last two decades. These were the first two Cannabis Cups, 2 years after its introduction:

- 1st Prize HighTimes Cannabis Cup 2000

- 3rd Prize High Times Cannabis Cup 2001

Blueberry weed is super fruity
Blueberry is an Indica dominant strain with one of the fruitiest flavor profiles you will ever have the pleasure to enjoy. The sweet aroma and delicious flavour of fresh blueberries ensure that this is unmistakably one of the finest and tastiest cannabis experiences. It’s like eating candy, very addictive and joyful! No wonder this legendary strain was used as the genetic foundation for so many of todays most popular modern cannabis varieties.

Blueberry buds are resinous and compact
Blueberry buds can be compact and very resinous. THC levels of around 20% are not unusual. It is a vigorous plant with large fan leaves. Blueberry can yield very well when grown in optimum conditions. She has a favourable calyx-to-leaf ratio which makes her easy to trim.

Dutch Passion Blueberry: one of the most rewarding cannabis strains
Original Blueberry is the flagship strain of the Blue Family. The Blueberry name was chosen because of the blue hues in the flowers and leaves, combined with an incredible aroma which is amazingly close to the smell and taste of real blueberries.

Blueberry was introduced to the Dutch market in 1998 together with Blue Velvet, Blue Moonshine, Flo and Blue Heaven - the other members of the Blue Family. All of them were originally bred by DJ Short and adopted by Dutch Passion in a cooperation with the Canadian breeder.

Although the variety is mostly Indica dominant, just the right amount of Sativa genes gives the high a unique effect. Instead of being devastating, as you might expect with such an Indica dominant strain, the high is clear and euphoric. It provides the user with a long-lasting high which is known to be very pleasant and up-lifting.

Blueberry strain info: A connoisseur’s delight!
Blueberry is a heavily resinous mostly Indica strain (about 80% Indica, 20% Sativa) mainly consisting of an Afghani Indica. The Sativa genetics come from a Thai Sativa and to a minor degree also from an Oaxacan (Mexican) Sativa. This unique three-way cross is the genetic foundation for the Blueberry strain and her many offspring.

Most plants have a compact growth pattern with sturdy stems and very large, broad fan leaves. The internodes can be quite close together and stems can turn purple. Blueberry can also produce some beautiful colours in the leaves and flowers.

Original Blueberry achieved a legendary status along with an immense number of followers. During more recent years Blueberry has been used to make countless new and popular crosses e.g. Blue Dream, Mazar x Blueberry (formerly Skywalker), Mazar x Blueberry OG (formerly Skywalker OG), Blueberry Headband, Blueberry Diesel and Blue Cookies just to name a few.

Blueberry is ready to harvest after around 8-9 weeks indoors. Outdoor she can reach maximum heights of 2.5-3m and is harvested around the start/middle of Autumn.

The genetics used to create Blueberry ensure the following characteristics:

A strong and sturdy plant which can yield very well both indoors and outdoors if grown in optimum conditions
Short internodal distances with dense flower clusters and a good calyx-to-leaf ratio
An amazing smoke/vape experience, one of the fruitiest strains on the planet
Blueberry may not be the easiest variety for beginners but she will reward the experienced grower with a bountiful harvest of one of the very best original cannabis varieties. She can be grown both indoors and outdoors.

Purple Kush weed vs Blueberry
Anyone that enjoys the rich taste and great visual appeal of Purple Kush weed will love growing Blueberry seeds. Both varieties offer blue and purple hues to the buds along with a THC rich, indulgent smoke quality. Old school connoisseurs might argue that Blueberry has earned its place in the cannabis hall of fame thanks to the extravagantly delicious taste, aroma and potency.

Blueberry effects
Blueberry is a very special Indica, despite being about 80% Indica dominant, the high is not too stoney or sleepy. It has a strong effect and the right amount of Sativa genes to make the high clear and euphoric. Our original Blueberry has a perfectly balanced high which makes it useful for morning and day-time use. It will not knock you out although it will definitely medicate you sufficiently. It will give users a hugely enjoyable feel-good body effect and put big smiles on their faces. With THC levels reaching 20% this is definitely a powerful variety.

Blueberry strain flowering time
We typically recommend a vegetative period of about 4-6 weeks. When you have only a few plants per m2 then we recommended using about 6 weeks of veg. With more plants per m2 you can use 4 weeks of veg. Although it is mostly Indica dominant, Blueberry can still stretch during flowering. This is due to the presence of Sativa genetics used in the breeding of Blueberry.

Outdoors, Blueberry has the potential to reach a significant size in optimum conditions. Ideally the weather should be mild/temperate with plenty of sun and some wind to reduce the possibility of the buds being damaged by mould and fungus. When grown in favourable conditions she has the potential to yield heavily. Some growers have succeeded in harvests over 2kg per plant.

Blueberry can have large fan leaves which act as enormous solar panels, converting light into energy. Strong stems and shorter internodal spacing makes her a great candidate for SOG-type growing styles.

The flowering time is about 8-9 weeks. In combination with the recommended veg phase it takes around 12-15 weeks from seed to harvest.

The yield of the Blueberry
Blueberry produces above average harvests of the finest quality cannabis; between 350 and 450 grams per m2 is possible. The compact plants will carry dense and heavy flowers.

Our expert advice
Blueberry isn’t the easiest variety for newer growers and can be a fussy feeder. But she will repay the more experienced growers with a beautiful harvest of perhaps one of the best cannabis varieties available. We recommend that growers ensure their grow-room conditions are as good as possible. Blueberry thrives in a stable growing environment. The climate, nutrients, soil and lighting need to be optimised for her to feel at home and deliver her full potential.

A cold climate will encourage the production of purple and blue hues. If you are growing her indoors, try to let some cold air flow into the grow-room at the end of flowering for an extravagant visual effect.

Handle her well and you will be rewarded with one of the best tasting cannabis varieties ever created!

More info about Blueberry
Blueberry is a legendary, premium potency Indica with a favourable calyx-to-leaf ratio which makes her easy to trim. She can have a striking resemblance to the White Widow strain when it comes to the sheer amount of white crystals which cover the bud. The purple/blue hues make this strain even better eye-candy.

Growers simply adore her amazing bag appeal. This is surely A++ quality flower. When she is slow-dried and cured properly there are not many strains that are able to beat this luxurious level of genuine connoisseur quality.

Blueberry is one of those exclusive varieties which will put a smile on any growers face each time they check their plants. That special Blueberry aroma makes it all worth it. Most growers cannot wait until harvest to vape/smoke and taste the buds!

Blueberry is available in both regular and feminized seeds, as well as autoflower seeds."
Orange Hill Special,"Why should I buy Orange Hill Special feminised seeds?
Orange Hill Special is one of our most special cannabis strains, created by crossing the legendary Orange Bud and Californian Orange

Orange Hill Special, a very potent cup winning cannabis variety
Orange Hill Special won the 3rd prize at the Highlife Cup (Bio Category) in 2015 the year after her introduction, and the 1st prize at Copa Cannabica Expo Industria in 2021 (Outdoor category). This lady is known for her thick ""frosty"" buds and a sky-high THC percentage!

Orange Hill Special has a citrus dominant aroma with notes of lemon, orange and pine
Orange Hill Special produces very generous, high quality yields with a fresh aroma and citrus flavour. Her scent can best be described as a mix of citrus fruit (lemon, orange, mandarin) and pine. In general, all phenotypes are quite citrus dominant in aroma. Some even smell exactly like oranges! These sweet but also sometimes sour scents are easy to recognise and will make you think of a tasty orange soft drink.

When the buds are crushed, the lemon scent comes out more strongly, and you will sometimes smell haze-like notes. It is a blend of spicy scents with sweet and sour overtones of lemon and orange. The taste is again citrus dominant with a kind of sweet and sour skunky twist, with notes of pine and earth. Anyone who likes an extremely fruity terpene profile should definitely give this strain a try!

Orange Hill Special is a very potent cannabis strain with a high yield
Orange Hill Special was developed by crossing two of our classic and well-known orange-family strains; Orange Bud and Californian Orange. The aim of this project was to make an even more potent and better version of this already very strong and stable parent genetics. We succeeded. The strain is known for a sky-high THC percentage averaging 20% and this can go up to nearly 25% in the right hands and circumstances. In addition to her potential, she also produces very thick buds and a fat yield!

What kind of genetics are exactly in Orange Hill Special?
Orange Hill Special is a special Orange Skunk selection and a welcome addition to the Orange Family of Dutch Passion. She was developed with genetics from our beloved Orange Bud and California Orange. This cross has been further stabilised for 6 generations to achieve a completely new and stable Orange variety. This variety is 50% indica, 50% sativa with a high THC content of 21%. Orange Hill Special is a must for fans of our Orange Family varieties. Developed by the producer of Power Plant, Ultimate, Skunk # 11 and many others. It is available in both feminised and regular seeds.

Orange Hill Special has large, full buds with a thick resin layer and a strong citrus-dominant aroma
Orange Hill Special is a special Skunk selection developed to obtain the ideal combination of a strong citrus aroma, a skunky orange flavor and a powerful THC-rich high. This strain, like all of our original Skunk genetics, is easy to grow. These genetics are also known for their high yields that can reach well above average. Orange Hill Special is a 50/50 Indica / Sativa hybrid variety which will have an average flowering time of 9 weeks. The plants have quite some vigour and will reach an average height of around 1 meter with a typical pre-growth (vegetative) period.

She produces some genuinely beautiful buds to look at. The flowers are really bursting with trichomes, a look with a microscope shows the true potential of this strain. The light green buds are covered in a thick white resin layer with beautiful orange and sometimes light brown hairs.

It is an easy variety to cut/manicure with a favourable flower-to-leaf ratio. This also makes her interesting for the more commercial growers who are looking for high potency, a good yield and a short processing time. Orange Hill Special is one of the best received photoperiod strains and with over 21% THC (from an independent lab result lab result shortly after launch). This is also a strong lady suitable for more experienced smokers.

Her plant structure is best described as medium. The internode distance is short to medium and the leaves are of a hybrid structure that will have the appearance of a perfect hybrid cannabis strain. Not too thick, not too narrow - somewhere in between. During the growth phase she may show a slightly more compact plant and leaf structure, but once flowering starts you will discover her hybrid character.

She does well in natural as well as SOG and SCROG cultivation. Topping and fimming is recommended during the growing phase to give her a more bushy appearance. This will also give her more evenly distributed large buds and ultimately a higher yield.

The genetics used for Orange Hill Special guarantee the following properties:

A medium plant with a hybrid plant/leaf structure and very full buds
A high yielding plant with resinous flowers
Very fruity citrus-dominant aroma and a high THC level

This 50/50 hybrid cannabis strain has a hybrid effect, which combines both a head high with a body stone. It is a mix of sitting in the ""zone"" and dreaming away and relaxing. During smoking / vaping you can taste a sweet and fruity flavour. The high hits quickly and also lasts for a long time. The high is both mentally stimulating and physically numbing, but it is by no means a couch potato. This makes this strain extremely suitable for users (including medical users) who are looking for a strain that can both relieve stress and provide energy during the day.

In low doses, this is an ideal strain to relieve stress while still being able to accomplish all kinds of tasks. Some users call it a mild body up-high. It can help improve your mood and boost your creativity. Orange Hill Special has a balanced high that has inherited about the same amount Indica and Sativa genetics.

The bloom time of Orange Hill Special
Orange Hill Special has an average flowering time of approximately 8-9 weeks from the time she is put on a 12/12 light schedule. The plants usually stay around 75 - 125 cm, when they have only been given a few (3-4) weeks of vegetative growth. Of course, this also strongly depends on the conditions in which it is grown. She responds well to topping and fimming and therefore remains a lot more compact.

The strain grows for an average of 2-3 weeks during the flowering phase with the most stretching in the first and second week of 12/12. In some phenotypes, the first flower hairs start to appear from the 2nd week of flowering. After about 4 weeks all plants have come to a stop and the plants become full of white flower hairs. From this moment on, the internodes will start to fill with long, continuous flowers.

The yield of Orange Hill Special
Orange Hill Special is one of our XXL photoperiod strains. She is known for a very high yield of the highest quality. Her average flowering time of 9 weeks ensures that she has enough time to produce very large and heavy blooms. The plants grow to about 1m high with many side branches that are full of sticky buds.

Supporting the buds with sticks and ropes is recommended, as well as the use of a support net to keep all buds upright. On average, yields of 500-600g / m2 are possible. However, in the hands of an expert, and in combination with certain growth techniques and methods, even higher yields are possible. Topping and fimming works as previously indicated, this increases yield. The same applies to a SCROG. Use this in combination with a strong LED light, a hydro system and additional CO2 to boost yields to unprecedented heights.

Outdoors, Orange Hill Special can also provide a very large yield. Several kilos per plant is possible when grown for a long time in full sun and in very large (smart) pots. These are robust plants with thick branches and very thick blooms. It is also highly recommended to support the buds outdoors during the flowering phase. Because of the weight, the branches can sag completely outside and even break off, especially when there is a lot of wind at the end of the bloom phase. She mainly likes a warm, dry and sunny climate, which makes her less suitable for growing in temperate (and the more northerly / southerly) climates.

Advice from our experts
Orange Hill Special is the best yielding plant in the Orange Family. Little nutrition is required during the growth period. During the flowering period of 8-9 weeks we recommend extra nutrition. Always start with a low dose and work your way up. If the plants are light green, it is best to give a little more nutrition (rich in N - nitrogen), if they are dark green (and possibly with yellow / brown leaf tips) and the leaves turn into claws, then you should reduce the nutritional value/EC to lower levels.

From seed you will often see that different phenotypes also have different nutritional needs. You can address this by moving the pH value slightly up and down. This allows the plants to absorb nutrients in a wider range, but keep in mind that on average you should always be between 5.5 - 6.5 (ideal is normally around 5.8).

We also recommend topping and/or fimming this plant. This can be done several times during a long growing (veg) period. If the pre-growth period is not long (eg only 3-4 weeks), we recommend doing this a maximum of once. Topping or fimming in the flowering phase is strongly discouraged. A SCROG can be the ultimate growing method for the highest yield.

Information about Orange Hill Special
Orange Hill Special is a beautiful cannabis strain. Her big buds, pungent aroma, thick resin layer and high THC content make this an overall winner. Some phenotypes can even show a little colour and complete the overall picture. This strain is known for a fruity aromatic bouquet of citrus and oranges. The taste is reminiscent of orange flavoured soft drinks and hash. The more earthy and piney notes make it very complex."

The orange dominant aroma and taste is truly fantastic. This strain is also known for a pleasant relaxed hybrid high. The effect is energetic, euphoric, slightly uplifting but also physically calming
Californian Orange, a beloved cup winning old-school cannabis variety
Californian Orange has won several cups over the years. This unique 'Orange' cannabis strain won her first prize in 2013. She then took first prize at the Copa Txapelketa in Spain. In 2016 she even won 2 different cups at the same event in Argentina. She took first place at the Copa Cannabis in both the Outdoor category and the Extract category. This showed everyone that she is not only a very suitable plant for both outdoor and indoor cultivation, but also for making cannabis extracts.

Californian Orange has a citrus-dominant aroma with notes of orange, mandarin, lemon and earth
Californian Orange, the name says it all, California oranges. This cannabis strain has a lot of citrus terpenes and the proportion of myrcene and limonene in this strain is high compared to other strains. Most plants have a strong citrus aroma and strong citrus taste. However, there are also phenotypes that can taste a bit more floral and tropical with occasional earthy notes.

All plants have significant resin production, which extends well into the leaves. It’s a sticky strain! It's not the most potent strain when it comes to THC, she scores medium to high here, but it is one with a very potent and pungent terpene profile.

The scent can start gently during flowering, but once it is there you will enjoy a wonderful fresh citrus scent. The smell can sometimes be a bit sour with mainly citrus/lime-dominant notes. The pure taste of orange and mandarin oranges mixed with a bit of earth/skunk makes this a very tasty old-school USA strain.

Californian Orange is a cannabis strain with a rich history that originated in California, USA
Good connections in the breeding world were the basis of Dutch Passion's success in the early years. The California tour in the 1970s proved to be the perfect opportunity to find a new cannabis strain with a unique flavor profile. The goal: to find a strain with a real orange/lemon scent and taste. Californian Orange was found and the genetics were taken to Amsterdam. Selective breeding was used and seeds were soon produced for the European growing community. The rest is history.

What exactly are Californian Orange genetics?
Californian Orange also known as; ‘Cali Orange’, ‘Cali-O’ and ‘Cali Orange Bud’ is a stabilised hybrid cannabis strain with Californian roots. This 50/50 Indica/Sativa strain was crossed in the 1980s and is available exclusively from Dutch Passion. The genetics of this variety originated from an exceptional Californian plant with a very pungent terpene profile of ripe oranges and mandarins with an earthy background. It is a true old-school USA classic of the highest quality.

This traditional California cannabis plant originated in the hippy era. Developed during the 1970s, brought to the Netherlands and bred in the 1980s in order to make the seeds available in Europe as well. Californian Orange is a very uniform and robust Orange variety, a popular cannabis strain from launch and still a sought-after strain among connoisseurs today.

Californian Orange has big sticky buds with a thick resin layer and a strong citrus dominant aroma
Californian Orange is a strong and stable strain with a solid layer of resin and trichomes, even on the leaves. In some cases, classic old-school varieties, such as our Cali-O retain a large number of loyal, repeat growers. Even decades after she was first launched, despite all the new and hip cannabis strains that have been developed in recent years.

This original Dutch Passion strain has more than earned its place. Most growers like the old-fashioned effect, a clear energetic up-high, and the excellent terpene profile. This intense orange scent and taste will never get boring. The yield of Californian Orange is medium to large, but the smoking experience is anything but average. The high is really nice and relaxing, it gives you energy, makes you euphoric and makes you dream away. This effect has ensured a loyal fan base.

This lady prefers a stable indoor climate. She will need about 9 to a maximum of 10 weeks indoors to fully flower. It is a good strain for growing on hydro, or for growing with the SOG technique. She is known for producing a thick main bloom but also works well as a multi-topped bush. She also thrives naturally, typically growing into a 1-meter-tall plant with a normal pre-growth period.

It is easy to grow and does not require any special techniques to achieve a good result. The buds of our Californian Orange are covered in a generous layer of resin. They look beautiful and are also quite sticky. It is a strain with a normal flower-to-leaf ratio. Her plant structure can best be described as medium.

The internode spacing is short to medium and the leaves are of a hybrid structure giving the appearance of a perfect hybrid. Beautiful large leaves that show both the appearance of a Sativa and an Indica.

The genetics used for Californian Orange guarantee the following properties:

A medium sized strain with a hybrid plant and leaf structure and very resinous buds
Californian Orange has a fantastic terpene profile, the intense smell and taste of oranges and other citrus fruits is never boring
The buds have an average THC level and a pleasant, energetic, euphoric high
Californian Orange is suitable for both beginners and experts. It is a plant that is easy to grow

Effects of Californian Orange
This variety is very popular for its strong clear 'up' high. A special variety for great socialising. If you smoke more, the high becomes heavier, and more physical, but the quality does not diminish. This is a great variety to smoke at a party or during the day without worrying about getting stuck on the couch. If you consume a larger dose of this strain, you can expect calming, heavier, more physical effects.

But Californian Orange doesn't make you lazy or sleepy. It is a nice hybrid high that always provides a balanced effect that is both mental and physical. It can influence and speed up your thoughts. In general, this strain will make you relax, you will be happy and de-stressed and will enjoy a boost in your energy levels.

The flowering time of Californian Orange
Californian Orange has an average flowering time of 9 weeks. Some phenotypes may be a week faster, especially when grown in ideal conditions. Outdoors, or indoors in unfavourable conditions, she may take a little longer to mature. Then she will take about 10 weeks before she can be harvested. The plants are medium in size and grow to about 1 metre when pre-grown for about a month.

This strain does not stretch very much, she will continue to grow for about 2 (up to a maximum of 3) weeks during the flowering phase with the most stretch in the first and second week of 12/12. You should therefore take this into account. If you want to keep her small and low, you can top or fim her.

You could also snap/bend or super crop the highest branches/blooms once the flowering phase has started. This ensures that the stretch is somewhat inhibited. Outdoors she is less suitable for growing in temperate climates and is best grown in a dry and sunny climate.

This strain copes well with warm temperatures. This is why she performs well in Mediterranean countries and will be ready for harvest there around the end of September, beginning of October.

The yield of Californian Orange
Californian Orange produces XL yields of around 400-450 grams/m² and the plants grow to an average height of 1 to 2 m (for outdoor cultivation). This is a beautiful resinous variety of a very high quality. The flowers become quite compact for a hybrid and will therefore put quite a bit of weight on the scales. She is not the most widely branched plant but rather a nice compact tree.

Some buds can get quite firm and heavy. Growing her naturally can help support the heavy buds towards the end of the flowering phase. This can be done with sticks, string or a support net. Outdoors, in a sunny climate, you can harvest between 250-500g per plant. Give her enough root space so that she can develop well.

Advice from our experts
Californian Orange is one of Dutch Passion's ultimate classics. This strain has been around since the seed bank officially started trading. And she is still a favourite among the connoisseurs. This strain grows best in a stable and steady climate. 20-27 degrees Celsius is really ideal for her. This strain can be sensitive to light stress, so make sure the room is completely closed with no light leaks.

It is also best to keep the lamps at the right distance so that no 'light burn' occurs. This of course applies to all varieties, but if you want a nice resin-rich bloom that remains compact and does not 'foxtail', then this is extra important with this variety. She can also tolerate somewhat lower temperatures during the flowering phase, which often creates a very special autumn colour 'fade'.

Just make sure that nighttime temperatures don't drop below 16-17 degrees in an indoor grow as below that point it can cause problems. All in all a very classic, unique and uniform 'Orange' variety which, in terms of smell and taste, is not inferior to other new varieties such as 'Tangie, Mimosa' etc.

Californian Orange information
Californian Orange has a very fruity and citrus dominant terpene profile. These 'orange' varieties were an instant hit and are still very popular today. Dutch Passion's Californian Orange is a stabilised variety with an average THC level and an intense, yet relaxed effect. The buds are highly resinous and popular with cannabis concentrate makers. This strain guarantees a unique, dreamlike California cannabis experience!"

Very sweet aroma and fruity flavors

Compact buds with one of the highest THC levels

Quality of the flowers is top-notch with an amazing bag appeal
Meringue has a very sweet aroma and fruity flavour
Meringue is a hybrid indica/sativa strain with a complex fruity aroma that leans to the tangy side of the spectrum but a bit sweeter. It smells like oranges, mango and honey with some earthy, sour hints. Her aroma profile is also very pungent.

Meringue is a connoisseur’s delight
Meringue is a high-quality strain. She might not be the biggest overall yielder but the level of quality is definitely a reason to keep growing her again and again. Expect solid yields of stunning looking buds. Although the flowers can be a bit smaller, they are rock-hard and thus will still put down some weight on the scale.

When handled well she will deliver you some of the most beautiful looking nuggets on the planet. The dark hues in the flowers and leaves makes the white layer of resin really pop out for an eye-catching bag appeal.

Meringue strain info: The fruitiest USA genetics
Meringue is grown by crossing Wedding Cake x Animal Cookies.

Wedding Cake, also known as Pink Cookies, is a USA cross of the famous Girl Scout Cookies and Cherry Pie. These 2 strains make for the intense sweet tangy taste of the variety. It is also noted for its extremely high THC content.

Animal Cookies is another popular USA variety which is a child of the legendary GSC line and Fire OG. She is a clone-only variety that flowers in about 9 week and grows very dense and compact buds that can show some dark colourations in the flowers. This strain has a sweet and sour aroma with a strong body-effect that will suit the more experienced smoker.

The genetics used to create Meringue ensure the following characteristics:

A sweet tangy aroma from the Wedding Cake

The dense, compact and coloured buds from the Animal Cookies

High potency levels thanks to both the Wedding Cake and Animal Cookies genetics
Meringue is top-notch variety with a high cannabinoid profile and an intensely sweet, pungent aroma.

Meringue effects
Meringue is a crossing of 2 popular hybrid USA strains. She leans a bit more to the Indica side which is shown in the shorter flowering time and bud structure. The effect of the variety is quite euphoric with a powerful sense of well being and relaxation. When you smoke more during a short period of time you will be rewarded with a deep body stone which could give a couch-lock experience.

Meringue feminised seeds vs Lemon Meringue strain
Any fans of the USA Lemon Meringue variety will love the Dutch Passion Meringue. Both varieties share a THC rich high and a connoisseur flavour profile. However feminised seeds of the Dutch Passion Meringue are thought to produce frostier plants and a superior vaping experience.

The growth and flowering time of Meringue
We recommend a veg period of about 4-6 weeks for these feminised seeds. Meringue can have a bit of a slow start while showing some stretch during the latter part of the grow period. On the other hand, she doesn’t stretch a lot during flowering, so she can be a bit challenging to understand. Meringue can have quite an unusual growth pattern with leaves that have elongated stems and which are pointed upwards with some distance to the main stem. This requires the use of certain growing techniques, like leaf tucking, to make sure she receives sufficient light from top to bottom.

Meringue stays fairly compact and within 3-4 weeks there is already a lot of resin on the flowers. After 6 weeks of flowering the buds start to show orange pistils, they seem to ripen quite fast. Luckily all plants show amazing resin production, making them very appealing to the eye.

The flowering time is about 8 weeks. In combination with the recommended veg phase, it will take around 12-14 weeks from cannabis seed to harvest.

The yield of the Meringue
Meringue produces XL harvests of top-notch quality cannabis; between 400 and 500 grams per m2 is possible. The buds are really frosty and dense.

Our expert advice:
Meringue is the perfect strain for professional home growers or licensed producers looking for a variety with the highest possible resin levels. Buds are literally coated in layers of resin. We would recommend to look out for the plants which show the most hybrid leaf and plant structure.

These are generally the biggest and best yielding phenotypes. Consider using a UVB light during the last few weeks of flowering and notice how the trichome production goes into overdrive. If you’re looking for something truly unique with an amazing bag appeal then please look no further, Meringue is the strain you need!

More info about Meringue
Meringue isn’t the most straightforward plant to grow so she can be a bit challenging to understand. The thing that stands out the most is the slightly unusual growth pattern, therefore more leaf picking is necessary, otherwise the lower buds will not receive enough light.

Because of the slightly larger internodal distance, buds don’t have the tendency to become really big, which could make her a bit more interesting for growers with higher humidity levels. There should be enough fresh air around these flowers though, because they become rock-hard.

Buds are covered in trichomes, lab results showed all phenotypes were close to and above 20% THC, suited for hardcore smokers."
Kerosene Krash,"Why should I buy Kerosene Krash feminized seeds?
She is a relatively compact cannabis plant with good internodal distance and beautiful large flowers.
It is an excellent Indica dominant hybrid with a complex terpene profile and pungent aroma.
This THC-rich plant has super sticky and compact buds.
She flowers quickly and within this short time she will provide you with some of the tastiest and strongest cannabis buds you have ever tasted.
This variety offers unsurpassed quality in terms of aroma, taste and effect. A small percentage of the plants can develop male flowers, which is expressed most heavily when plants suffer from severe stress. It is advised to check your plants thoroughly during flowering and act immediately before the male flowers open and pollinate the other plants.
Kerosene Krash has a pungent earthy, gas/diesel and slightly fruity kush aroma
Kerosene Krash is one of the most pungent and most powerful cannabis strains in our collection. This strain was created by crossing a GG #4 (formerly Gorilla Glue) with a male Sherbet. Both parents are known worldwide for their potent buds and strong aroma. GG#4 leans towards earthy, sour and gassy, Sherbet is a little sweeter and fruitier.

Both varieties are bestsellers in the U.S. and have amassed a large number of fans and repeat growers. Our crossing combines the best of these 2 worlds, ensuring that the potent and aromatic nature of both strains is preserved. Expect wonderful smelling buds which are so pungent that an ordinary plastic ziplock bag simply can't contain the penetrating aroma. Most phenotypes will lean more towards the earthy, gassy side. But there are also phenotypes that lean a little more towards the Sherbet's fruity, sometimes sweet and citrusy side.

Kerosene Krash has shimmering buds full of trichomes and terpenes
Kerosene Krash has super sticky buds full of trichomes. The strain gets its name from the strong pungent odour that seems to get everywhere and go through any bag! It’s similar to the pungent smell of gasoline/kerosene. Some phenotypes lean heavily towards the strong diesel/gassy side of terpenes spectrum. These are our personal favorites, well worth looking out for!

How can you make Kerosene Krash even more potent ?
There are several 'tricks' to make a strain even more potent. Some are scientifically proven methods. Others may not be proven, but are common practice within the growers community.

If we can recommend one method from the scientific side, we would recommend the use of a UVB lamp. These lamps, which mainly emit UVB light, give the plant that extra push to produce even more trichomes and THC. A UVB lamp only needs to be used for 3-4 hours a day during the last 3-4 weeks. This simulates strong sunlight, as found in equatorial summer sun. The plant protects its flowers by producing even more trichomes. This mimics the increased pigment production in our skin as we are exposed to strong sun.

One tip/trick is to leave the plant in the dark for the last 2-3 days before harvest. This is thought to increase resin production. But be sure remember to water your plant, even in the dark they will still drink.

Another tip used by Licensed Producers is to add cold/chilled air during the overnight dark period. This is thought to make weed even more potent and may also encourage colour production in the buds, adding to the visual appeal. Other shock methods used to stress the plant, such as watering the plant with ice cubes, remain popular with some growers despite lack of scientific evidence.

Kerosene Krash is a fast bloomer with compact flowers and a good yield
Kerosene Krash is an Indica dominant hybrid cannabis strain which arose from our USA breeding program. This strain belongs to our USA-special family, which contains only the very best genetics from the USA. As mentioned earlier, Kerosene Krash was created by crossing a beautiful female GG # 4 (Gorilla Glue # 4 aka. Original Glue) with a male Sherbet (aka. Sherbert). This hybrid was later stabilised and feminised to create the Kerosene Krash seeds that we sell today.

This strain is able to flower quickly. Most phenotypes you will encounter will be ready to harvest in about 8 weeks on average. Some plants seem to be ready after 7 weeks of 12/12 light, but we recommend giving them that extra 1 to 1.5 weeks. This is partly because the buds become even more compact and potent in the last 2 weeks, but also because the blooms pack on extra weight.

If you look at the trichomes with a microscope you can keep a close eye on the ripening process. Getting a good number of amber trichomes gives the high even more power!

Because Kerosene Krash flowers quickly, she usually remains a very compact plant. She is relatively small in comparison to other ""USA-special"" varieties because her stretch is minimal. She will only stretch in bloom for 2 to about 3 weeks. Some phenotypes come to a standstill very quickly, so it is recommended to extend the VEG period slightly to ultimately increase yield.

The plant structure is best described as compact. The internode distance is relatively small and the leaves are of a hybrid structure which leans more towards the Indica side.

The genetics used to create Kerosene Krash guarantee the following traits:

A compact plant with full, thick buds.
A complex terpene profile with a pungent odour and taste. This tasty hybrid also has an extremely high THC content.
This Indica dominant hybrid is easy to grow and has a very potent and pleasant high, it is a wonderful smoke.
Kerosene Krash is the ideal strain for true connoisseurs. The unique aroma and taste are what makes this strain so popular. A true taste explosion!
Effects of Kerosene Krash
Kerosene Krash is a real blast. She has THC-rich buds which can easily exceed 20% THC with the right care and in a good environment. Even among novice growers, she can achieve 15-20% THC without any problems. This ensures a strong high that hits quickly and lasts for a long time. The effect can best be described as relaxed and pleasant. It is a hybrid high that combines both physical and mental effects. The high comes in nicely, you don't have to smoke a lot to get 'stoned'. But if you do decide to smoke a little bit more, prepare to get seriously krashed!

The flowering time of Kerosene Krash
Kerosene Krash feminised seeds produce compact plants that will grow to an average size of 60cm - 80cm. She blooms relatively quickly. The majority of plants will be ready after 8 weeks of flowering. There are fast phenotypes, but we recommend giving these plants a minimum of 8 to 8.5 weeks. You don't want to miss out on the extra yield and potency produced at the end!

In less-than-perfect growing conditions it’s recommended to allow an extra week or so of bloom, i.e. 9-10 weeks.

Don't be afraid to allow Kerosene Krash a little longer in bloom if you want to ensure the highest yields. The buds are compact and completely covered by a thick layer of trichomes, which in turn will be bursting with terpenes and cannabinoids.

The yields from Kerosene Krash
Kerosene Krash can provide a good yield indoors. Harvests of 400-500g/m2 can be achieved if grown in perfect conditions.

Outside they can produce more than half a kg per plant. We recommend growing her in sunny and dry areas. Wet and cold outdoor climates climates are not recommended since they can cause bud rot and mold. Due to her fast flowering time she can be grown outside but only with a dry late summer/autumn period and shelter. A greenhouse is an option, if properly ventilated.

Advice from our experts:
During growth, this strain may not always react well to particularly strong light. We recommend that you slowly build up the light intensity so that Kerosene Krash can adapt to the light without stressing.

To achieve the highest yield you will either have to extend the vegetative growth period. Or you will need to work with more plants per m2 (SOG growing style), because of the minimal stretch during the flowering period. She can be grown in both a SOG and a SCROG and does very well on organic food.

Information about Kerosene Krash
Kerosene Krash is a strain that was developed by crossing two top class American strains. The genetics are mainly selected for potency and flavor profile. So expect the final dried and cured buds to deliver a particularly tasty and strong high. We are very proud of the result!"

Bubba Island Kush has an ‘old-school hash plant’ appearance with dark leaves and very white compact buds
Bubba Island Kush tends to develop very dark leaves at the end of the flowering phase. The colours can vary from red, light purple, very dark purple to almost black. The compact structure in combination with the dark leaves and very white buds give the plants a truly ‘old-school’ Afghan Hash plant appearance. Cold temperatures at night accelerate this process. When Bubba Island Kush is grown outdoors, you can expect a huge range of different colours on the leaves. Sometimes purple tones can also appear in the flowers, these are really beautiful phenotypes to see with a great 'bag appeal'.

What kind of genetics are there in Bubba Island Kush?
These very strong Kush genetics have their origins in North America. The geneticists at Dutch Passion developed this new strain by crossing (Grandaddy Purple x OG Kush) with a pre '98 Bubba Kush father. The average height is one metre. The fast flowering time of 7.5 weeks and the fruity sour Kush notes make Bubba Island Kush a very special Kush addition to the Dutch Passion collection. Bubba Island Kush is part of our USA Special seed collection, representing the very best genetics from the United States.

Bubba Island Kush is a fast bloomer with compact flowers and a good yield
Bubba Island Kush is an Indica-dominant hybrid cannabis strain with a very fast flowering time of only 7-7.5 weeks. Due to this fast life cycle most plants usually remain compact and small, which makes this strain extremely suitable for a fast SOG cultivation. When you work with only a smaller number of plants per m², it is best to pre-grow a little longer (around 5-8 weeks depending on the number of plants per m²) in order to achieve a large yield with this variety.

Her compact growth structure with short internodes makes Bubba Island Kush a very suitable plant to grow with the SOG method. She also does well when grown naturally. Because of the strong branches and her compact structure she has no trouble standing upright, even when grown outdoors. Although she was originally developed as a cannabis strain for indoor cultivation, she can also be grown outdoors thanks to her fast flowering time.

Be careful with a lot of rain and moisture towards the end of the flowering phase. Due to the compact buds, it is recommended to place the plants under a shelter in late flowering. The colder night temperatures really create a beautiful color palette. The leaves can become very dark during the flowering phase. This variety will appeal to true Kush enthusiasts for her special appearance and tasty terpenes. During the fall/autumn, the plants often turn from dark green to red/purple eventually to dark purple or even completely black! The colder it is outside, the sooner you will see these colours.

Bubba Island Kush does not stretch much in bloom, usually coming to a complete stop within 2-3 weeks of the clock switching to 12/12 conditions. From that moment she will put all her energy into the development of her buds. The leaves have a true Indica appearance in the growth phase with thick, greasy fingers that are characteristic of the Indica heritage. Her plant structure can best be described as compact. The internode distance is relatively small and the leaves have a hybrid structure during the flowering phase that clearly leans more towards the Indica side.

The genetics used to create Bubba Island Kush guarantee the following traits:

A very compact plant with a fast flowering time
A complex terpene profile with a pungent sour, fruity Kush aroma and taste, this tasty Indica dominant USA-Kush hybrid also has a very high THC content.
A plant with beautiful dark colours which contrast nicely with the thick white layer of trichomes on the buds.
Bubba Island Kush is the ideal strain for the true Kush lover. Her complex terpene profile will make you want to grow her again and again!

Effects of Bubba Island Kush
Bubba Island Kush has a pleasant and satisfying high. Many smokers experience a powerful narcotic effect which acts on both the body and the mind. Physically, the high is very strong and ensures that you can relax and unwind. It is therefore the ideal cannabis strain for an evening 'binge-watching' your favourite series on Netflix. Sit back and relax! The mental effect matches the physical part perfectly. The strain gives you a feeling of well-being and brings you into a calm euphoric ecstasy. The high is strong and a small compact bud of this lady is enough to fill a big joint! Although her buds are usually a bit smaller than average, they are really hard and compact. Don't smoke too much in one go, because this strain is strong enough for more experienced smokers!

Bubba Island Kush bloom time
Bubba Island Kush is a very compact feminised cannabis strain that can flower very quickly. With an average flowering time of 7-8 weeks, she is one of our fastest flowering photoperiod cannabis strains. If you like a very strong narcotic effect, we recommend that you keep her in bloom for about a week longer. This ensures that most trichomes will turn amber. This provides an extremely potent body high that is unparalleled.

Due to the fast flowering time, the plants usually remain a bit smaller than other strains. So it is important to pre-grow her a little longer if you only work with a small number of plants per m². In a SOG this is not necessary and you get perfect Christmas trees with only a few weeks of growth. This allows very fast grow cycles with this variety.

The yield from Bubba Island Kush
Bubba Island Kush has been given an ‘L’ mark (for ‘Large’ harvests) because of its fairly good yield, though these are perhaps a little lower per m² than you might be used to from some Dutch Passion strains. But with her fast flowering time, she more than makes up for it. The average yield is somewhere between 350-450g/m² in an indoor grow with strong lights.

Outdoors, with proper care and pre-growth, she can yield around 500-750g per plant. Due to her fast flowering time, she can be grown in many different climates, but preferably one as dry as possible. For best results, grow her in a ventilated greenhouse or polytunnel, which protects her from the rain and reduces the risk of bud rot and mold.

Advice from our experts
Bubba Island Kush practically grows on her own, it is a fairly easy strain to grow. She does not require any special growing methods or feeding schedules to achieve a good and tasty end result. She is not a fussy eater in terms of nutrition and will thrive with just about any food line. However, for the tastiest results, we recommend growing her completely organically. This benefits the strong pungent aroma and taste!

If we can give a tip about this strain, it would be to say it’s important not to put her into bloom too early. The strain has little stretch in the flowering phase, so do not expect tall plants but rather compact bushy plants. She is very suitable for growing in a SOG but she can also be grown in a SCROG. The stiff and strong branches can also be cropped and super-cropped, they will not break easily. Topping and fimming is allowed in a SCROG, but in a SOG or in a natural way we strongly advise against this.

The beautiful, well stacked main bloom with glittering white trichomes on the often dark purple/black leaves is something you will not forget quickly!

What exactly are Master Kush genetics?
Master Kush is a very tough, easy-to-grow Afghan Indica variety. This is an original Kush variety from the 1980s. This strain is originally from the Hindu Kush Mountains in Northern Afghanistan. It is a pure Indica cannabis strain and is one of the oldest original Kush varieties.

This was a customer favourite decades before today's modern Kush strains (such as OG Kush) became popular. Master Kush is the right strain for growers seeking a powerful calming Indica high that is free of paranoia and that will leave both your body and mind relaxed. A potent strain that is loved by medical and recreational users alike.

Master Kush is a robust Indica-dominant Afghan cannabis strain with large buds and a favourable flower-to-leaf ratio
Master Kush is an easy-to-grow Indica. She is known for her robustness and ability to grow in a wide variety of conditions, coping better than others with periods of cold or heat. The origin of our Master Kush lies in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan. Strains from this region are known for their powerful and robust character, making them ideal for growers looking for a plant that can take a beating.

Master Kush is a compact variety that grows well in any medium, be it soil, hydro or coco. She thrives in most growing conditions. Master Kush is easy to clone and is a reliable, generous producer of very high quality cannabis. These cannabis seeds produce strong plants that are also suitable for the novice grower.

She is very easy to understand nutritionally and thrives in organic soil, which benefits her aroma and flavor profile. This lady has a less pungent odour during the early parts of her life, which may be useful to some growers. It is a compact to medium sized strain. She grows slightly taller than other smaller original Afghan Kush varieties such as Night Queen or Afghani #1.

The buds are large and heavy with long pistils that range from bright orange to brownish. Master Kush can be prone to mold in humid conditions due to the sheer size and density of the buds. That is why good ventilation and low humidity are of great importance. Her plant structure can best be described as compact to medium.

The internode distance is small, which ensures that the buds can stack nicely together. She has a short stretching phase of about 2-3 weeks but grows strongly once the clock is turned to 12/12. The long heavy buds usually have few leaves, which makes this cannabis strain easy to cut and is therefore also very popular with commercial growers in combination with the short flowering time.

The genetics used for Master Kush guarantee the following properties:

A compact/medium size Afghan Indica with a high yield
Master Kush has long full buds and a relatively fast flowering time of 8-9 weeks on average
It is a robust strain that thrives on any type of medium in any growing environment
Master Kush is easy to grow and has a powerful narcotic high with a calming and soothing effect.

Effects of Master Kush
Master Kush is a potent strain with pure Indica potency. She is known for a strong, potent and long lasting high. She has a powerful effect and a heavy body stone. This is a strain with a good balance between physical and mental effects. It gives the user physical relaxation without the full mind-numbing effect that sometimes occurs with pure Indicas.

Master Kush also seems to provide an energy boost to your senses, making them seem sharper than usual. Master Kush's high is initially euphoric and up-lifting. As time goes by, the high transforms into a more relaxing and calming sense of well-being.

It is really a very nice strain to smoke in the evening. Medical users report that this strain has anti-stress and anti-paranoia properties. When you consume a large dose you will notice a strong sense of couch lock. Ideal for a relaxed weekend day or a lazy evening!

The flowering time of Master Kush
Master Kush has a short flowering time of 8 weeks on average. Some phenotypes take just a week longer to fully mature. These are often the slightly larger plants that can bloom for 60-65 days on a 12/12 light cycle.

In perfect conditions you will see that Master Kush needs around 56 days. Master Kush stretches a little more during the flowering phase than her Afghan sister Night Queen. This ensures that you can work with a slightly shorter vegetative growth phase.

Master Kush can also be grown outdoors, but it should be noted that she does not like humid conditions. In general, this is a strain that does well outdoors. But she also likes a dry climate. Temperature swinging between day and night extremes are not a problem, but too much rain or moisture from morning dew can cause bud rot during the late flowering phase.

Preferably grow her in a sunny and dry climate. If you want to grow her in a temperate climate, make sure you have a shelter and sufficient ventilation. A greenhouse that can be darkened earlier is often also a good solution. Outdoors, she will be ready for harvest in late September to mid-October (depending on latitude and climate).

The yield from Master Kush
Master Kush is a heavy yielding strain. It is not difficult for novice growers to get a heavy yield. Her long buds are firm and quite weighty. On average, yields of around 400 g/m2 can be achieved. In the hands of an expert and with the SCROG method, yields of up to 500 g/m2 are possible. It is also possible to grow Master Kush in a SOG.

Outdoors, yields will range from tens of grams (for plants in small pots) to 500-750g per plant for sturdy outdoor plants in large pots or in the ground. In a sunny and dry climate she can really grow into a true monster.

Indoors, she thrives in a wide variety of conditions and does well on soil, coco and hydro. Whether you're using HPS bulbs or LED bulbs (or maybe even CMH or Plasma), this lady always knows how to perform. Very uniform and commercial.

Expert advice when growing Master Kush cannabis seeds
Master Kush is a potent Afghan Indica that grows practically on her own. It is one of the most robust and strong strains for indoor growing. She likes a stable and dry climate, so keep that in mind if you want to get the finest possible results. In addition, Master Kush likes a generously sized grow container with sufficient soil, especially when you work with low numbers of plants per m2.

She doesn't like wet feet and would rather be a little drier than too wet. This lady does really well on a Hydro system. In combination with LED lamps and possibly a UV lamp (UVB and UVA) the buds become even stickier and more potent!

Provide adequate ventilation and low humidity so that the buds can harden off well and do not get rot/mould. This Indica grows as a compact hybrid photoperiod so you can work with a shorter pre-growth period than would be required with other Indica-dominant strains.

Information about Master Kush
Master Kush is a favourite among the Dutch Passion team, a strain that we can recommend to everyone. Apart from the ease of growth, it is a potent cannabis strain with a powerful high and a very pleasant effect. The strong 'body stone' allows you to relax and unwind!"

Mazar has an earthy hash aroma with notes of pine, frankincense and citrus, in short a pungent and highly aromatic terpene profile
Mazar has incredibly sticky buds, a favourite feature of Indica dominant Kush varieties from the Mazar-i-Sharif region. They are also known for a very aromatic terpene profile - the buds smell super strong and pungent. In general, the scent of Afghan hash dominates, with earthy and piney scents predominating.

In addition, the aroma has hints of herbs, incense, citrus and sometimes sweeter floral notes. Squeezing the buds brings out the more fruity, citrus-dominant notes. When you smoke this strain you mainly taste the piney, earthy flavors with a hint of fruit, which is exactly what gives this strain that authentic old-school weed experience.

Growers who have been around for several years know how to recognise and appreciate this strain like no other. If you've never tasted a real Mazar before, it's definitely time to start growing these resin-infused buds!

Mazar is a robust cannabis plant with a high yield
Mazar is an original Afghan Indica crossed with a special phenotype from our legendary Skunk #1. Pure Indica's from Afghanistan are known for their robustness and ease of cultivation. These plants grow and flower quickly. They can usually withstand colder temperatures and develop very strong branches with thick buds and a good layer of sticky trichomes.

Crossing this Afghanica with our Skunk # 1 significantly increased yields, giving the plants a slightly less short/stocky structure, making them more suitable for all types of growing conditions and growers. Mazar is ideal for beginners and can tolerate a fair amount of nutrition during both growth and flowering. With an average flowering time of 8-9 weeks, she is still a fast flowering Indica.

What kind of genetics are there exactly in Mazar?
Mazar is one of the most potent and best varieties Dutch Passion has ever created. Our original Mazar is an 1980s classic, developed from a special Skunk # 1 crossed with a high-quality Afghan. In 1997 the genetic mix was improved, and today Mazar is still one of our best-selling and most appreciated varieties ever.

Mazar is a medium sized plant with compact, all-white buds with high potency
Mazar is a medium sized Indica dominant cannabis strain with a compact plant and bud structure. Her Indica characteristics are most evident during the growth phase. As soon as she starts flowering her Skunk characteristics come to the fore a bit more.

She has significantly more stretch than completely pure Afghan Indicas. This means more buds and bigger buds, which ultimately benefits the yield. When grown naturally, it usually has a Christmas tree-like appearance with heavy side branches. The thick buds can use some support during the end of flowering to stay upright.

The robustness and vigour make Mazar an excellent choice for novice growers. It is a true Afghan hash plant with high potency and extreme resin production.

During the growth phase, it can have a short, compact structure with very fat dark green Indica leaves. Some phenotypes have a slightly more open hybrid structure, the fan leaves of these plants can become very large.

The most compact Indica dominant phenos are perfect plants for a SOG. The thick branches, fast flowering phase and a large compact dominant main bloom ensure that you can achieve very high yields. The plants that lean more towards a hybrid structure (with a little more Skunk genetics) can also be grown perfectly in a SCROG. You can use these different growing techniques to increase the yield.

The stretch is average for an Indica dominant cannabis plant. She continues to grow in the flowering phase for approximately 2 to maximum 3 weeks. Plants are known for the thick branches that can bear large sturdy flowers. The internode distance is short to medium, which ensures that large long blooms will develop.

The genetics used for Mazar guarantees the following properties:

A medium sized Indica dominant Afghan hash plant with a high yield.
A compact plant/bloom structure and buds with a thick sticky layer of trichomes.
A high THC content and a very pungent terpene profile, a must for true old-school Kush aficionados.
Mazar is a strong Indica with a THC percentage of around 20%, provided it is grown in good conditions. In the hands of an expert, even higher THC percentages and very high yields are possible.

Effects of Mazar
Mazar has a powerful and long-lasting effect. These old-school genetics produce cannabis buds of the highest quality with a wonderfully relaxing effect. The high is incredibly strong and is certainly one of the most powerful Indica's in our collection. The high hits quickly, after just a few puffs you can feel the effect.

It is a combination of a ""body high"" and a ""head high"", in which the more physical effects predominate. You will enjoy a sense of happiness, familiarity and numbness with a mental quality that is contemplative and meditative. In short, it is a relaxing effect that leaves you in a relaxed state.

As soon as the high hits, you feel your limbs and eyelids getting heavier and heavier, so you can sink into the couch. A real couch locker. This heavy-duty couch-lock makes Mazar very popular with recreational and medical users alike. It is the perfect variety to smoke during the day or in the evening. It provides a long-lasting effect that can last for several hours.

The flowering time of Mazar
Mazar flowers on average for around 8 weeks, but there are some phenotypes that need just a little longer, maximum around 9-10 weeks. These are usually the slightly more hybrid plants with just a little more Skunk genetics.

It is a compact cannabis variety with a small to medium stretch during the flowering phase. The strain continues to grow for about 2-3 weeks after the light cycle has changed to 12/12. From week 4, the plants start to smell very strongly.

Keep this in mind when you grow indoors because the pungent Kush scent is best handled by new carbon filters.

The yield of Mazar
Mazar has been given an XL mark, this fast hybrid Indica dominant Afghan hash plant can provide high yields. The buds become very dense and heavy.

Due to the sturdy branches and good internode distance, they also grow large in size. On average, yields of around 400-500 g/m2 are possible. Even higher yields can be achieved in the hands of an expert.

The leaf-to-flower ratio is excellent and the buds are usually covered with beautiful orange hairs and a thick layer of sticky resin. She can also be grown outdoors in sunnier, warmer climates. In the more temperate climates she can be grown under a shelter, such as a greenhouse. The compact, heavy buds do not like high humidity, so please take this into account both indoors and outdoors to prevent mold and bud rot.

Advice from our experts
Mazar is an uncomplicated cannabis strain that is easy to grow by any type of grower or with any type of grow method. Her genetic background ensures a very stable and uniform end result. It is an Indica dominant variety with only a small proportion of Sativa genetics, which means that this plant is slightly less stocky and has a higher yield than the purest Indica's. The combination of quality, yield, speed, robustness and ease of cultivation has made this strain a true classic and a legendary strain.

The most important tip we can give is to keep both humidity and temperature under control. She doesn't like extremely high temperatures, which can cause the buds to become more ""fluffy"". Low humidity is important to prevent mold and rot. In addition, good air circulation is also important for our Kush Mazar. This ensures that the branches become stronger and they can support more weight.

Do you want to get the highest possible yield from this strain? Then ensure a stable climate with a low maximum temperature (25-27ºC) in combination with low humidity and sufficient air exchange / displacement.

Information about Mazar
Mazar is one of our legendary cannabis varieties that has been on the bestseller list for decades. It is a unique Indica hybrid which is characterised by very white compact buds with a strong pungent hash smell. All the phenotypes you can find are easy to grow and typically have large, full blooms with a solid resin layer.

Some phenos have more of a golf-ball structure and others have slightly more ""foxtails"" in the blooms. Characteristic of all plants is the thick white layer of trichomes and the compactness of the flowers with a good flower-leaf ratio. Mazar is a recognised classic and multiple award-winner. Highly recommended!"

Be sure to give the plants the time they need because during the last few weeks, the buds will thicken enormously!

Outdoors at Dutch latitude, she will be ready approximately by the end of October or the beginning of November. This makes her a little less suitable for outdoor cultivation in moderate climates. However, she can be successfully grown outdoors in the Mediterranean area. Plants there are on average between 2-3 m high and will be ready for harvest in early / mid-October. Euforia also does very well in greenhouses and in poly tunnels, which also produce excellent yields.

The yield of Euforia
Euforia® is a strong and stable variety with a high potential yield. Generous harvests of between 400-600g /m2 are possible on average. She does well on (organic) soil, on coco-fibre or in a hydro system. Organic soil and nutrition is recommended if you are looking for the most pungent aroma and flavor.

Outdoors (or in a greenhouse / polytunnel) in a warm and sunny climate, Euforia can grow into a true monster, especially with sufficient vegetative growth. Plants taller than 3.5 m are the rule rather than the exception. This is a plant that can grow really vigorously, ideal for growers with a lot of space. Grow her either in a large smart pot or in the ground.

For both indoor and outdoor cultivation, it is recommended to support the buds towards the end of the flowering phase. This benefits the yield

Advice from our experts
Euforia is an easy-to-grow photoperiod cannabis strain that we can recommend for beginners. It is especially important for novice growers to take it easy with the nutritional dosage in the beginning. Start gradually, err on the side of caution and try to give a little less than the nutrient chart suggests. Sativa strains generally do not like a strong diet, especially in the early stages.

If you work with many plants on a m2, for example in a SOG culture, only short pre-growth (vegetative growth) periods are required. If you work with fewer plants per m2, she loves to be in a large pot and grown in a SCROG.

Keep in mind that this strain was originally for indoor cultivation. However, over the years we have had several growers in various warm countries who have successfully grown Euforia outdoors. In sunny places with a dry climate, such as southern France, Spain, southern Italy and Greece, Euforia can thrive and provide you with a large, potent harvest.

Information about Euforia
Euforia® is one of our original legendary cannabis strains with a large repeat customer base. Many growers love Euforia because she always knows how to deliver, even in less favourable conditions. She is known for her high quality buds and strong euphoric up-high. She is also available as regular seeds and autoflower seeds.

Purple #1 is a beautiful classic purple hybrid cannabis plant. This purple variety has a really old-school aroma and taste. Her aroma is best described as earthy, tart, fruity, floral and spicy.

The buds of Purple #1 are purple and have a beautiful bag appeal
Purple #1 mainly has purple coloured phenotypes, but with some exceptions there are also completely green phenotypes to be found. These are usually the slightly more potent phenos which can smell just a bit more fruity and sweeter than the purple plants.

All plants can show purple hues on both leaves and buds when grown outdoors. Cold night temperatures will cause the buds and leaves of this strain to darken and develop more purple tones. The completely purple buds look the most beautiful and in our opinion also have the most bag appeal.

What exactly are the genetics in Purple #1?
Purple # 1 is the world famous original purple cannabis seed variety from the 1980s. Purple #1 is renowned for its uniquely beautiful colours and great ""high"". Our original Purple #1 consists of approximately 50% sativa and 50% indica.

The indica comes from a very special purple Afghan that has been carefully crossed in the Netherlands to create a strong outdoor plant that is fully adapted to the Dutch climate. It is a robust outdoor plant with beautiful bright purple colours at the end of the flowering phase.

This strain was one of the first commercial purple varieties. Purple # 1 has been used extensively by other breeders and seed banks to develop new purple varieties. Purple # 1 is available in both regular and feminised cannabis seeds.

Purple #1 is a robust purple cannabis plant with a fast flowering time and beautiful purple buds that can grow up to 50cm long
Purple #1 is a strong hybrid cannabis plant with a Sativa appearance and impressive purple colours. This strain produces very sticky, fruity, purple coloured buds. The flowers turn purple shortly after they have started bloom.

The first flowering hairs to appear are normally white on most cannabis strains, with our Purple #1 these pistils can range from purple or pink to even dark purple.

The strain is known for its short flowering time, which can ensure a quick harvest outdoors. At Dutch latitudes she will, in most cases, be ready in the month of September. Some phenotypes are ready in early / mid-September and the longest flowering phenotypes finish bloom in early October.

She is very suitable for outdoor cultivation as well as cultivation in greenhouses. The leaves show clear Sativa characteristics with very slender long leaves and beautiful purple colours.

Purple #1 is easy to grow and responds well to a variety of growth techniques such as LST (Low Stress Training) and HST (High Stress Training). She can also be grown indoors, but was originally developed for outdoor and greenhouse cultivation.

She also grows well as a multi-topped bush and can provide large yields. If your plant grows naturally, she will usually have a beautiful Christmas tree structure. The plants are on average around 1.5-2.5 meters tall. She is a strong open-ground variety that can take a beating (and short periods of bad weather), but also does well in pots. Also suitable as a guerrilla plant.

Her internode distance is short to medium. She can grow very long buds of around 50 cm. These thick buds have a more airy character, which makes them very weather resistant, so bud rot and mold have less influence on Purple # 1.

The genetics used to breed Purple # 1 guarantee the following traits:

A beautiful old-school purple cannabis strain with a short flowering time and a large yield
A robust outdoor plant which is very suitable for growing in moderate, and usually wetter, climates. She is extremely suitable for outdoor and greenhouse cultivation. She is also a good plant for guerrilla cultivation
Her long purple buds are really beautiful to look at, despite her smaller stature she can still provide good yields
Purple # 1 is a hybrid cannabis strain with a relaxed and euphoric up-high. The aroma and taste are reminiscent of an old-school Afghan hash plant with the well-known earthy and spicy notes.

Effects of Purple #1
Purple #1 has a high that sets in relatively quickly. The high is more ""up"" high than ""stoned"" with a slightly rough, yet subtle aroma. The effect is not very long-lasting, but this is offset by the quality of the experience.

Due to its balanced Indica / Sativa genetics, it is a hybrid effect with both physical and mental effects. It's a good combination of physical relaxation and mental uplifting euphoria. The initial effects are quickly noticeable and strongly present. It is not a ""creeper"" at all.

The more Sativa-dominant side of the genetics provides an uplifting and thought-stimulating effect. The Indica genetics provide a relaxing effect with a mild ""couch-lock"", if you smoke enough it can make you a bit sleepy and also have a sedative effect.

It is said to be a pleasant smoking experience that can put you in a relaxed relaxed meditative state. Because the effect does not last very long and you can continue with your day shortly after the high has worn off, this also makes her ideal for a ""wake & bake"" without losing your entire day afterwards.

This strain does not have a long after-effect and even if you smoke her late at night, you will wake up the next morning with a clear head.

Purple #1 flowering time
Purple #1 has an average flowering time of 8 weeks, which means that outdoors she is normally ready for harvesting in September. Indoors, she will take approximately 50-60 days to finish on a 12/12 light schedule.

This strain was originally developed outdoors as a traditional outdoor variety. The hybrid is therefore also very suitable as a guerrilla plant and for cultivation in greenhouses. But she can also be grown indoors under lights.

Be careful with the distance from the plant to the lamp, because if it is too short it can show signs of light burn. This can affect the quality as well as the stability of this strain.

She also grows very easily and prefers to be grown in organic soil. This ultimately ensures the most pronounced aroma profile.

The yield of Purple #1
The plants reach an average height of 1.5-2.5 meters outside with long blooms of about 40-50 cm and can yield between 100-350 grams per plant, depending on the growing conditions. In the most favourable circumstances and in the hands of an expert, slightly higher yields are of course possible.

Purple #1 can yield around 350-400g / m2 of dry buds indoors and therefore has an average yield. Most plants will also show beautiful purple colours indoors. Outdoors, this 50/50 hybrid will be ready in September (at Dutch latitudes) and will be able to provide any type of grower with a tasty harvest. Her robustness and resistance make her an excellent and popular choice for the outdoor grower.

Advice from our experts
Purple # 1 is an outdoor variety that is easy to grow. This strain does not require any special growing techniques or feeding schedules to achieve good results. She is an excellent plant for a guerrilla grow and will provide you with a nice outdoor cannabis harvest at all times.

This is a true purple strain which is far superior to the rubbish that is sometimes offered on the street as purple weed. Because of her beautiful bright purple colours, she has a great bag appeal that will appeal to everyone.

If you would like to keep her smaller, it is possible to top or FIM this strain. You can also limit her height with all kinds of different growing techniques. If you really want to keep her low, you can even SCROG this lady. This can be done both outside and inside.

A general tip for an outdoor grow is that towards the end of the flowering phase you should pay close attention to whether there is dead leaf material on the plant (especially near the top). This is best done ASAP, remove it so that there is as little chance of mold / bud rot as possible.

Give this strain some extra organic PK-Booster during the middle of the flowering phase or brew an organic tea to make the buds thicker and more compact. For the rest, Purple # 1 grows almost by herself and you can let nature do her work.

Due to the different phenotypes found in this strain, there is something for everyone. The green phenotypes usually taste slightly sweeter than the purple phenotype.

Shaman is the perfect choice for the novice outdoor grower
Shaman has colour in about 50% of the plants. This can vary from light pink/purple hues to completely purple flowers which can even show very dark, almost black, hues. This makes this lady really beautiful to see.

On certain phenotypes, the flower hairs also change to pink/purple instead of the orange, brown color usually seen in a cannabis plant. Shaman delivers good yields in a wide variety of conditions and she is the perfect choice for the outdoor grower. Thanks to the powerful parent genetics she is also very suitable for the novice grower.

What kind of genetics are exactly in Shaman?
Shaman is an original Dutch Passion classic that has been in the collection for several decades and is still very much loved. It is a true outdoor plant that was developed for growing in greenhouses and outdoor cultivation.

Shaman stems from a breeding program in which an early Skunk was crossed with a colourful Purple strain. This breeding program was perfected when a very robust and easy to grow outdoor variety emerged.

This reliable and very potent F1 hybrid is the result of an exceptional quality male Purple #1 and a Skunk female. It is a Sativa dominant variety with only a small proportion of Indica genes.

This makes her exceptional in high and looks, but with a fast flowering time. Shaman was originally developed as a regular seed, but is also available as feminised cannabis seeds.

Shaman is a robust purple cannabis plant with a fast flowering time and beautiful purple buds that can grow up to 50cm in length
Shaman is a striking, elegant plant with clear Sativa characteristics. Her structure is more open and 'stretchy', the leaves are slender and long. The buds are long with a more airy, open structure. She also has long internodes between the large buds.

About half of the plants develop a pink/purple color in the flowers, ranging from light pink to completely dark purple buds. As the season comes to an end and the temperature drops, the beautiful purple hues will emerge more and more. It is truly a beautiful plant to see and photograph.

Shaman is a perfect plant for growing in greenhouses and for outdoor cultivation. She is very resistant to bud rot and fungus. Due to her open bloom structure, she is much less bothered by this.

This does not mean that she is not susceptible, but she will cope much better with long periods of bad weather, e.g. with a lot of rain and high humidity, than most traditional (outdoor) varieties.

This lady does as well in the ground as as she does in pots. She can be grown as a guerrilla plant but also does very well in a pot on a balcony or in the backyard. Due to her Sativa-dominant character, she can grow quite large, especially if you have started pre-growing in time.

Shaman responds well to topping and fimming and this can be done several times during growth. If she still stretches too much and gets too big during flowering, you can also bend her and (super) crop her.

At Dutch latitudes, this strain needs approximately until the end of September/early October to finish flowering. In greenhouses she is ready for harvest, on average, after 7-9 weeks.

Shaman is a strong plant that has a beautiful Christmas tree structure if you let her grow naturally. However, if you top her several times, she will grow very strongly in width and you will get a beautiful bushy plant.

The plants are on average between 1-2 meters high, but with the right pre-growth they can grow to more than 3 meters both in the open ground and in (large) pots. Shaman's internode distance is medium to large.

Some blooms really get extremely large and can become solid lengths of bud between 40 and 75 cm long. A beautiful Sativa dominant lady that will amaze!

The genetics used to grow Shaman guarantee the following traits:

A Sativa dominant outdoor strain with a fast flowering time of 8 weeks on average
A tough outdoor variety that can take a beating, Shaman does well in pots but also as an open ground variety
This lady grows into a beautiful Christmas tree structure with long, thick blooms, about half of the plants have purple colours
Shaman is a Sativa dominant cannabis strain with great hybrid potency. Her smooth sweet taste combined with a sensual up-high makes this a lovely strain to smoke.

Effects of Shaman
Shaman is a very robust purple cannabis strain with a slight creative 'up-high'. The effect is instantly recognisable as that of a Sativa. The mental aspect is much stronger than the physical aspect. The high can therefore best be described as a 'head-high' instead of a 'body stone'.

The mental effect provides a more energetic, social uplifting high. Also, Shaman can produce effects causing deep, philosophical thought. It's a good choice if you're looking for a strain that will keep you active.

This is the ideal strain for a good conversation or at a party. The high is of medium strength and lasts for a medium duration/time. The smooth, sensual fruity taste brings you a wonderfully relaxed, high-quality Sativa effect.

The bloom time of Shaman
Shaman has an average flowering time of 8 weeks. Outdoors, the flowering period lasts until the end of September/beginning of October. In greenhouses she is ready for harvest within 7-9 weeks on average. Some phenotypes are just a little faster and will be ready for harvest in 50 days, others take a little longer and can take up to 65 days to fully flower.

Despite being a hybrid cannabis plant, Shaman mainly behaves like a pure Sativa. Tall elegant plants with slender leaves and long buds. The biggest advantage of this Sativa is that the genetics makes her ideal for growing in more temperate climates.

These hybrid cannabis seeds produces long blooms like a Sativa, but with the short fast flowering time of an Indica.

The yield of Shaman
Shaman averages around 1-1.5 meters in height with very slender and long Sativa dominant blooms. Because Shaman was developed as an outdoor plant and for cultivation in greenhouses, we usually speak less about the yield per m2. But to give an estimate anyway, this yield is about 400g/m2.

Shaman performs best outdoors and mainly in greenhouses, where yields of several hundred grams per plant are possible, even for novice growers. Plants here are on average between 2-3 meters tall.

The bigger the pot and the longer the growth phase lasts, the bigger the plant can eventually grow. In the hands of an experienced grower, yields of around 500-750 grams per plant are possible.

Advice from our experts
Shaman is a strong Sativa dominant outdoor strain that is easy to grow. She is a vigorous plant that can grow very quickly in the right conditions. If you want to limit her height somewhat, you can use different growing techniques to achieve this. You can bend, snap, crop & super crop her.

It is also possible to grow this lady in a SCROG, both outdoors and in a greenhouse. If you grow Shaman in a colder and wet climate, it is recommended to defoliate her at the end of the growth phase. This ensures that there is less chance of dead leaves that can get stuck in the buds, increasing the possibility of mold.

More information about Shaman
This variety will produce very good yields if grown with a little love. It is the perfect choice for the outdoor and greenhouse grower looking for strong robust genetics. Shaman does not produce cannabis that will knock you out completely, it is a wonderfully relaxed Sativa high that will make you social, creative and active. Because of the stimulating properties Shaman is also very suitable to use during the day."

The subtle taste is a real treat for outdoor gourmets!

Pamir Gold is very suitable as a guerrilla plant and also does well in mountainous areas
Pamir Gold is one of Dutch Passion's two 'highland' varieties and one of the strongest and most robust cannabis seeds for guerrilla cultivation available worldwide. It may not be the fastest bloomer, but she is very resistant to bad weather and cold temperatures.

She can even be grown in the mountains or hilly areas where the differences in day and night temperatures are usually much greater than at sea level. Despite the large, full blooms, the chance of mold and bud rot is extremely small.

What kind of genetics are in Pamir Gold?
The origin of Pamir Gold lies in the western part of the Himalayas in Tajikistan. This region, known for its high Pamir mountain peaks that rise to about 7,500 m above sea level, is also known as 'the roof of the world'. This is where the Pamir Gold name comes from.

In the Swiss Alps, we adapted Pamir Gold to the Swiss Highlands through a selection that took several years. We eventually used these selections for seed production in the Netherlands. This is an Indica dominant hybrid that has unprecedented toughness and robustness.

Her genetic background makes her very suitable for growing in mountainous areas. A changeable climate does not stop this lady and she can also be grown in temperate climates at sea level. The ultimate guerrilla plant because of her natural durability!

Pamir Gold is a tough outdoor plant with a favourable flower-to-leaf ratio and a high yield
Pamir Gold is a very tough outdoor plant. This strain was developed for outdoor cultivation but can also be grown indoors under artificial light. It is a compact, medium sized plant that is highly resistant to mold, mildew and bud rot. The yield is above average, and this is mainly due to her full, firm buds. In the open ground, this strain grows to about 1.5-2.5 meters.

She has a fast-to-medium flowering time. Cold temperatures and large differences in day and night temperatures can delay flowering time. But fear not, this lady continues to grow steadily and the buds get fuller and harder as time goes by. She has a favourable flower-to-leaf ratio with only small leaves surrounding the flower. The flowers can be quite long and usually grow closely in a large bloom.

It is truly a beautiful open ground variety. She will grow towers of buds that may well require some support towards the end of the flowering phase. Whether you live on a hill a few hundred meters above sea level or in the mountains at 1000-2000 m high, or even in a wet and cold climate at sea level, Pamir Gold always knows how to deliver!

There are hardly any cannabis strains to be found that are as suitable for a wet, cold and changeable climate as our Pamir Gold. This cannabis strain is based on a landrace from the western Himalayas and can provide a good harvest even in harsh conditions.

This is an easy strain to grow and great for beginners growing cannabis for the first time. She does not require any special feeding schedules or growing methods to achieve good results. Give the plant a sunny spot in your garden (or in nature) and she will reward you with a bountiful harvest.

Pamir Gold is a hybrid cannabis strain, which means that her appearance can show both Indica and Sativa characteristics. The leaves are usually thinner and slender during the flowering phase, some plants can foxtail and become very long, but have the compactness of an Indica. The blooms can be thicker than your fist and therefore provide a large yield.

The internode distance of Pamir Gold is short to medium. The main buds can grow nicely together with only small gaps in the bloom. The favourable flower-to-leaf ratio ensures that fewer rotten leaves can linger, which in turn reduces the chance of mold and bud rot even further.

The genetics used to grow Pamir Gold guarantee the following properties:

A uniquely robust hybrid cannabis plant with a high yield
Pamir Gold is perfectly suited to outdoor cultivation. She does very well as an open ground variety and her high durability makes her the ultimate plant for guerrilla growers
She produces nice full blooms with a favourable flower-to-leaf ratio. This ensures that cutting and trimming this strain is quick and easy
Pamir Gold can be grown in almost any type of climate and in almost any location, whether you live in the hills, mountains or near the sea, this strain is guaranteed to provide you with a generous harvest.

Effects of Pamir Gold
Pamir Gold has a subtle but pleasant high. It is a hybrid high with both a physical and mental effect. The THC level of this highland variety delivers a medium strength effect which means that the high never becomes overwhelming, but rather lasts very gradually and does not peak. The effect is initially more physical than mental and users experience a calm sense of well-being mixed with physical relaxation that transforms into a subtle couch-lock feeling.

This strain also seems to help with pain relief. The mental effect mainly gives a slightly euphoric and invigorating 'head-rush'. She gives a small boost of energy and lets your thoughts flow wonderfully, it is a nice strain to get creative with. Pamir Gold seems to open new cerebral connections and ensures that you remain very relaxed at the same time. This is a marijuana strain that is suitable for use in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

The flowering time of Pamir Gold
Pamir Gold has an average bloom time of about 7-9 weeks. This strongly depends on the climate and the conditions in which she is grown. In an ideal indoor setting, or in an outdoor climate with stable temperatures and plenty of sunshine, most plants will be ready for harvest within 7-8 weeks of flowering. In a changeable climate she can take a few weeks longer and flower for up to 10 weeks.

Even though some plants need a little longer, they will flower, even in the most appalling conditions. This hybrid is a real outdoor champ, her genetic background and many years of selection in the Swiss Alps make this the ultimate plant for guerrilla and mountain growers. Pamir Gold can also be grown in greenhouses. She actually does well everywhere, a very potent and stable outdoor strain that allows anyone to produce a top yield.

The yield from Pamir Gold
Pamir Gold grows to about 1.5-2.5 meters outdoors with a compact to medium sized plant structure. This is a plant that does not stretch very much, it has a more bushy Indica character. As a result, the buds become quite firm and thick. The leaves, on the other hand, can show slightly more Sativa characteristics. The yield indoors will be around 400g/m2. That in a very short flowering time of about 7-8 weeks.

Outdoors, Pamir Gold can provide very good yields. Plants that have developed well can yield approximately 250-500 grams. Even guerrilla plants grown in harsh environments can yield several hundred grams per plant. For guerrilla cultivation, the yield will be somewhere between 50-200g per plant, depending on the pre-growth/veg period, the weather and the number of hours of sunlight per day.

Advice from our experts
Pamir Gold does well outdoors in the ground, but can also be grown in pots. Keep in mind that she prefers aerated soil and will benefit from being grown in pots which ensure a lot of air, such as a root pouch, smart pot or air pot. This helps to prevent root rot.

Although Pamir Gold is a very robust plant outdoors, we recommend that you pre-grow her indoors for a few weeks. It's not essential per se, but it gives the ladies a useful developmental edge. Germination is possible outdoors, but because the cannabis seedling is then at her most fragile/vulnerable stage, we don’t recommend this for guerrilla cultivation.

Use a plant with an established root system and a number of growth shoots and the rest of the cultivation will go smoothly. Even in the most difficult conditions, this lady can provide you with a rich harvest. If you grow her outdoors, provide a sheltered spot, but one that is still windy, this will make for stronger branches that will eventually support larger blooms.

More information about Pamir Gold
Pamir Gold is the perfect choice for both the outdoor grower and the guerrilla grower who lives at higher altitudes. But this outdoor cannabis seed also thrives in flat lower altitude regions nearer sea level. It is therefore also one of the most suitable strains for outdoor cultivation in temperate climates. Her strong resistance to mold/bud rot and good yields have made this strain very popular within the outdoor grower community."

Snow Bud is a very tough and robust outdoor plant. Her Sativa dominant genetics ensure that she can cope well with a humid climate, while on the other hand her Indica genes ensure good resistance to the cold.

Together this makes for a potent robust cannabis plant that is perfectly suited for growing in mountainous areas. There are very few varieties on the market that can really handle the changeable conditions in the mountains.

Despite these very challenging conditions, this strain still manages to provide every grower with a generous outdoor harvest.

What exactly are the genetics in Snow Bud?
Snow Bud is our second High Altitude strain for mountainous regions. This robust and durable cannabis strain was developed in the mountains over several generations. Snow Bud is a hybrid created by crossing an Afghan Indica with a South African Sativa.

Using these old-school landrace genetics, a new hybrid has emerged that is highly resistant to a wide variety of climatic conditions. As with our Pamir Gold, Snow Bud's selection work was done in the Swiss Alps. This has ensured that this strain has learned to adapt perfectly to the usually colder conditions that apply in the mountains.

It is a Sativa dominant hybrid with about 60-75% Sativa genetics and only 25-40% Indica genetics. The name Snow Bud refers to the large amount of white stamen pistils in the buds as well as the thick layer of trichomes that can be found on the buds.

Snow Bud is a hardy outdoor variety with an average flowering time of 8 weeks and a guaranteed high yield
Snow Bud is easy to grow and suitable even for beginners who have never grown a plant before. She is particularly forgiving and has a high tolerance for beginner mistakes with e.g. the correct nutrient dosage, watering and climate. Her robustness allows anyone to successfully finish Snow Bud, even in the most challenging conditions!

Snow Bud is very robust and has good resistance to mold, mildew and bud rot. It is also a perfect outdoor plant for the guerrilla grower, both in high altitude areas and at sea level. The yield of this strain is above average and she produces plants averaging around 2 meters tall.

Snow Bud is a hybrid cannabis plant and only available as feminised cannabis seeds. It has been specially developed for outdoor cultivation, but can also be grown indoors under artificial light.

Although she feels most comfortable outside where she comes into her own, she can also be grown indoors in a hydro system or in a semi-hydro system such as Autopot. Indoors, she also does well under LED lighting and organic food. She can also be grown in greenhouses, making this strain a real 'all-rounder'.

It is a beautiful plant to look at, the appearance and structure tends most towards a Sativa. However, the fast flowering time and resistance to cold comes from her Afghan Indica genetics. She is a strong grower with long branches and a leaf structure that is quite Sativa dominant.

Expect large slender leaves with an average of 11 thin fingers, sometimes 13. The buds also grow long and are full of white flower hairs. These flowers can 'foxtail' and have a very favourable flower-to-leaf ratio. The tops seem to be snow covered with beautiful white crystals.

Snow Bud usually grows with a dominant and large main bud surrounded by many small side buds. When grown naturally without the use of any growing techniques, she can exhibit a Christmas tree structure with long and full side branches.

You can top or 'fim' her to limit her height. She does very well as an open ground variety but can also be grown in pots. The internode distance of Snow Bud is average, there are small spaces between most of the buds that prevent them from growing together as a solid mass. This ensures that she is less susceptible to mold and bud rot.

The genetics used to grow Snow Bud guarantee the following traits:

A very robust Sativa dominant outdoor strain with a fast flowering time of approximately 8 weeks
A durable, resistant plant suitable for outdoor growing in mountainous areas. She is highly tolerant and thrives in a wide variety of conditions. Even cold and wet climates can't get this lady down!
Snow Bud has a beautiful Sativa structure with full long flowers, the completely white buds seem to have been snowed under
Snow Bud is very suitable for beginners, she is easy to grow and has the ability to deliver a generous harvest to any type of grower.
Effects of Snow Bud
Snow Bud has a strong mental effect, a real head high. The physical effect is only minimal and at most provides a slightly relaxing physical intoxication. Muscles will relax but it is certainly not a narcotic effect. The up-high is of medium strength but provides a nice energetic buzz. Most users report feeling happy after smoking this strain.

Snow Bud is ideal for use during the day or early evening. It is a subtle high that is potent enough to put you in a relaxed yet energetic state of mind. There really isn't a time when the high might feel too intense or overwhelming.

However, that does not mean that this cannot happen. If you have a low tolerance or consume large doses, other effects can of course occur. All in all, a lovely Sativa high that will put you in a relaxed state.

The flowering time of Snow Bud
Snow Bud has a flowering time of approximately 8 weeks. Outdoors, the flowering period lasts until the end of September/early October. In greenhouses, she needs an average of 8 weeks to be ready for harvest.

There are sometimes slightly faster flowering phenotypes that take around 7 weeks. But there are also plants that will take around 9 weeks, especially when it is very cold.

Snow Bud has an average flowering time for a hybrid. Fortunately, most phenotypes are ready a lot faster than typical Sativa-dominant hybrid cannabis seeds. This makes her especially suitable for outdoor cultivation in mountainous areas.

An open bud structure combined with a fast flowering time and good resistance to cold has made these genetics particularly popular with growers living in the mountains.

The yield of Snow Bud
Snow Bud grows to an average height of around 1.5-2 meters, usually with large and slender Sativa leaves. During the growth phase she has a more hybrid character but during the flowering phase you will see that her structure as well as the buds show mainly Sativa characteristics.

Indoor yields of Snow Bud are a bit lower than most strains, averaging around 350-400g/m2. In ideal conditions, she can yield up to around 450g/m2.

She is most at ease outdoors, allowing good yields of several hundred grams per plant, even in the most severe climatic conditions in remote, mountainous areas. This is also an ideal strain for guerrilla growers.

Snow Bud is very robust and will reward you with a generous harvest at all times. If you provide veg growth via an early indoor start, she can grow up to around 2.5-3 meters outdoors.

Advice from our experts
Snow Bud is a strain that grows practically on her own, especially when grown outdoors. She can be grown in almost any type of climate. Preferably give her a sunny spot to get the highest possible yield. If you have chosen her as a guerrilla plant, we recommend preparing the soil well, preferably adding organic nutrients to the soil.

This ensures that the plant has everything it needs to grow well and make itself even more resistant to the elements. You can also scrog her for indoor cultivation if you work with few plants per m2. Then give her a slightly longer pre-growth period because she can sometimes be rather slow to get out of the starting blocks.

She can also be grown in a SOG for a high yield, cut out the bottom 2-4 branches in time so that she mainly focuses on a big sturdy main bud. Look at the trichomes with a microscope to choose the right time for harvest.

More information about Snow Bud
Snow Bud is the perfect choice for the outdoor and greenhouse grower who lives at higher altitudes. This strain was developed in the Swiss Alps and selected for her tough properties. This makes her the ultimate strain for growers looking for strong and robust genetics. Snow Bud is a classic cannabis strain that guarantees a delicious harvest!"

CBD Skunk Haze is the result of the joint project of Dutch Passion and the CBD Crew. The goal was to achieve the optimal ratio of 1:1 CBD:THC. Some medicinal users prefer low-THC varieties. The cannabis has a relaxing effect, but the intense effect that a high THC percentage gives does not occur.

Recreational users find that a high CBD percentage gives a very pleasant and gradual body high without paranoia. To develop this variety, we crossed our Haze/Skunk (winner of the 1992 High Times Cannabis Cup) with a variety that is high in CBD.

CBD Skunk Haze is a strong grower with big long buds, her Sativa dominant character makes her suitable for both SCROG and SOG growing methods
CBD Skunk Haze is a stabilised hybrid and produces large and tall plants. This Indica/Sativa hybrid produces plants with firm, compact buds and a good yield. It is a strain that produces beautiful dark green leaves, with thick veins on the backs of the leaves. The fingers of the blade and especially its edges resemble those of a saw, but luckily you don't have to be afraid to cut your fingers!

This is a variety that grows well indoors under artificial light as well as in a greenhouse. For a successful harvest in the greenhouse, it is recommended to grow in a controlled greenhouse. And if you grow in a temperate or northern climate, darken the greenhouse in time. She has an average flowering time of 10 weeks but faster phenotypes can be found as well. Grow her in a fully controlled indoor environment with an LED lamp for the best results.

It is a uniform and stable CBD strain. The plants grow quite evenly and during the flowering phase it is also noticeable that the bloom structure of the different phenotypes shows many similarities. The Haze/Skunk parent used for this cross clearly shows that she has transferred certain dominant traits. As soon as flowering has started, the plants have wonderful aromas.

By week 3-4, the formation of the buds is already well underway. And the development of the resin layer also starts early in the flowering phase. The buds eventually get really sticky and resinous. The amount of trichomes may be greater than you would expect. The buds of CBD Skunk Haze have the same appearance as a traditional photoperiod cannabis strain. It is a strain with a very good flower-to-leaf ratio and there are only small thin Sativa dominant leaves in the large flowers. This makes cutting very easy and fast.

The thick layer of resin and trichomes also makes this a very suitable strain for making cannabis concentrates or cannabis oil. It is a medium-sized plant that, due to its relatively limited stretching phase, is very suitable for various growing methods such as a SOG or SCROG. Most plants extend into the flowering phase for about 3 (up to a maximum of 4) weeks.

Her plant structure is best described as medium, the internode spacing is short to medium and the leaves have a structure that carries more Sativa-dominant characteristics, thin and long with very thin leaf blades.

The genetics used for CBD Skunk Haze guarantee the following properties:

A Sativa-dominant hybrid CBD-rich cannabis strain
Vigorous and strong plants with a demonstrably high CBD content and average THC percentage
Resin-rich buds with a good flower-to-leaf ratio and a strong spicy aroma with sharp Haze notes of pine and citrus
CBD Skunk Haze is an easy to grow CBD rich cannabis variety. You can grow this lady with all kinds of different cultivation methods and she does well in an indoor garden but also in a controlled greenhouse.

Effects of CBD Skunk Haze
CBD Skunk Haze has a unique high and comfortable effect. After a good vape/smoke session you will feel happy, stoned, satisfied and stress free. The effect is both physical and mental, but remains controllable at all times. Although you are (slightly) under the influence, you can still think and function well. Something that will usually no longer be possible after smoking a strong THC-rich strain.

It really is something you should try once. Then you may also understand why so many people appreciate these CBD-rich 1:1 strains. The effect of the CBD Skunk Haze is clear, uplifting and energetic, it also gives you a real 'body high' but a slightly relaxed variant. You stay sharp and focused.

The CBD in this strain brings a new dimension to cannabis' analgesic properties. It also ensures that people who have made their own cannabis oil from this can 'medicate' themselves while still maintaining a certain clarity. It is a very relaxing experience in itself and this feminised CBD cannabis strain is suitable for both medical and recreational users.

The flowering time of CBD Skunk Haze
CBD Skunk Haze has an average flowering time of about 10 weeks. There are also phenotypes that can be just a little faster, around 8.5-9 weeks, especially when grown indoors under ideal conditions. She tends to be more Sativa-dominant, which results in beautiful large flowers with little foliage and a good flower-to-leaf ratio.

She can also be grown in a greenhouse, but in temperate climates it will take until late October/early November to finish flowering. It is therefore recommended to start darkening the plants as early as the middle of July. As a result, she will be ready for harvest at the end of September, beginning of October. Both outdoors and indoors, this CBD strain produces resinous buds that look great and are quite sticky!

The yield of CBD Skunk Haze
CBD Skunk Haze is a medium to high yielding plant. In a good indoor grow she will be able to yield around 400-500g/m2. Don't harvest her too early, as that can lower your yield. Certainly during the last 2-3 weeks, quite a lot of weight is added.

During this ripening phase, the buds harden well and become firm/compact. She has been given an XL mark due to the large buds that this strain develops in a stable growing environment. CBD Skunk Haze can be grown in a SOG with an average pre-growth period.

This of course also depends on how much space there is between the plants and how big you want them to grow. She also does great in a SCROG, her slender leaves and strong branches make her well suited for this. You can get the highest yields from this strain in a SCROG. But you can also just grow her naturally and let it grow freely. Either way, she will provide you with a delicious harvest.

Advice from our experts
CBD Skunk Haze is an easy plant to grow. If you want to get the highest yield from her, we recommend topping her in the vegetative period. This will make her grow the side shoots much faster and give you a more evenly distributed field of buds. Even if you grow her in a SCROG, topping the plants is recommended.

She also likes a not-too-high temperature. If she is exposed to this, she can sometimes start 'foxtailing' a bit more. For the most beautiful buds, keep the maximum temperature between approximately 27-29 degrees. And preferably with a stable 20-22 degrees as night temperature.

Information on CBD Skunk Haze
In 2012, Dutch Passion partnered with the CBD Crew to develop a range of feminised cannabis seeds, all of which are rich in the cannabinoid CBD. A variety with more than 4 percent CBD is considered CBD rich. Typically, cannabis has a THC content of between 12 to 21 percent and a CBD content of 0.1 to 0.5 percent. CBD Skunk Haze is on average between 5-10% CBD and about the same amount of THC.

CBD has a number of important properties; it can help you relax/counteract nausea and makes it easier to fall asleep. CBD strains allow medical users to self-medicate while still maintaining a clear head and functioning normally. For recreational users, the CBD varieties are a milder, but no less pleasant, alternative to the common varieties."
Desfrán,"Why should I buy Desfrán feminised seeds?
Desfrán is a very special Sativa dominant photoperiod cannabis strain. She has a vigorous growth and flowering phase and ensures a high XXL yield.

This Sativa variety has gained an excellent reputation for her XXL yields and relatively short flowering time. The quality of the buds is very high and that is the reason that she has managed to win so many cannabis cups

Desfrán has buds with a unique and pungent aroma and sweet fruity taste. Its fruity and sweet notes are reminiscent of apple, pear, honey and caramel. A very special combination that you must try!

It is a strain with an average flowering time of between 9-12 weeks and a very unique high. The effects are sociable, bright, creative and energetic. Definitely not a couch-lock strain!
Desfrán, multiple cup winner
Desfrán has a woody, spicy, earthy and floral aroma, it is a wonderfully penetrating scent that will stay with you
Desfrán is a powerful Sativa with a unique aroma and taste. This terpene profile gives a fruity yet sweet taste like you've never tasted before. The aroma of Desfrán is reminiscent of pear and green apple. As soon as you step into the grow room, it's like you've stepped into a fruit orchard. Sweet, fruity and fresh notes of apple and pear fill the air.

The scent of some phenotypes leans more towards tropical fruits. Pineapple and melon are 2 other fruits that are often associated with Desfrán. Sweeter notes of caramel and honey make it very special and addictive! The taste of Desfrán is tropical and resembles pear mixed with caramel with hints of grapefruit and melon with a sour, fresh and spicy taste on the exhale.

Desfrán is a legendary Sativa based on the cup winning Destroyer cannabis variety based, very resinous and potent
Desfrán is a true Sativa. This long flowering cannabis variety is based on a number of Sativa landrace strains from America and Asia. She is a legendary cannabis strain made up of the cup-winning Destroyer genetics from South America. She guarantees strong, fast-growing plants with a considerable stretch. Her buds (with foxtails) are very resinous and sticky. THC percentages are usually around 20%, but some phenotypes can be a bit above this.

What kind of genetics is in Desfrán exactly?
Desfrán is a legendary South American variety that has won numerous cannabis cups. Desfrán is the result of a crossing of Destroyer with Destroyer, and was originally a three-way cross of Mexican Oaxaca, Colombian Punto Rojo and Meao Thai. Dutch Passion owes this variety to Alberto from Argentina, a master breeder and cannabis connoisseur and the owner of Haze magazine. With our first collaboration we wanted to introduce Desfrán in Europe.

Desfrán is a classic Sativa with a vigorous growth and flowering phase, she grows long buds and is ideal for a SOG and SCROG grow. This jungle Sativa has a great stretch during the flowering phase and very potent THC rich buds
Desfrán is a fast growing Sativa dominant cannabis plant with long, slender leaves and a vigorous growth and flowering phase. Once the plants have germinated, they will fill your space in no time.

During her vegetative growth phase, Desfrán needs few nutrients. She grows especially well in soil with plenty of room for the root system and also thrives very well under other growing methods. Desfrán is a full-bodied Sativa, allowing her to grow very tall and develop long branches that can take up all available growing space very quickly.

During vegetative growth, the plant can give off an intense fruity aroma when the trunk is rubbed firmly. In the flowering phase, the plant stretches and can triple its height. Desfrán is a very resinous variety, suitable for SOG and SCROG growing methods and usually takes 9-10 weeks to flower.

However, longer flowering phenotypes can be found that take up to 12 weeks to fully mature. A second internode bloom (or even third) is not exceptional. If you are looking for the ideal plant for a SCROG grow, you should give our Desfrán a try. This lady creates new branches quickly and her thin leaf structure makes for a very pleasant SCROG experience. If you prefer a SOG, Desfrán is also a suitable choice.

Her large and long stretching period in bloom means you can quickly set the plants to 12/12. Even directly from seed this may be desirable. We usually recommend a minimum growth phase of 1 week on 18/6, but this also depends on the size of the pots and the number of plants per m2. In terms of structure, she resembles a real jungle Sativa.

Desfrán grows unusually dense and compact buds. When dried, the buds resemble glazed pinecones. The buds can be very sticky and potent. Most of the flowers are completely covered with a thick layer of trichomes. Most phenotypes have foxtails which also give the flowers the true classic Sativa appearance. With the right lighting and care, the buds will become quite compact. They are certainly not fluffy.

During the flowering phase, this Sativa stretches quite a bit, tripling in size is the rule rather than the exception. This large stretch makes her the ideal lady for a SCROG grow. This also allows shorter pre-growth periods. This also makes her a very suitable plant for a very fast SOG cultivation. Her internode spacing is medium, she has slender leaves and fingers and a very favourable flower-to-leaf ratio.

The genetics used for Desfrán guarantee the following properties:

A vigorous cannabis strain that grows rapidly during both the growth and flowering phases
A Sativa with a great stretch during the flowering phase, these ladies typically stretch by 200-300% when the clock is set to 12/12
The flowers are relatively compact for a Sativa and she takes on average around 10-11 weeks to be ready for harvest
Desfrán is the perfect candidate if you are looking for a true Sativa that has a nice stretch during flowering and is well suited for both a quick SOG and SCROG grow. Its structure makes it the ultimate lady to bend, snap and super crop.

Effects of Desfrán
Desfrán is a THC rich variety that will average around 20% THC. In the hands of an expert, higher cannabinoid levels cannot be ruled out. The high of this strain is exceptional, it is a very clear high with a strong uplifting and energetic effect. An 'up-high' that gives you a lot of focus and alertness.

A pure sativa to love! An early harvest (still with clear trichomes) can lead to cannabis that provides a very cerebral and psychedelic high. If Desfrán is harvested late, the taste is sweeter and it is a real 'destroyer'.

The combination of the terpenes and the high cannabinoid levels make this a unique Sativa variety. If you consume a little more the effect can be a bit 'trippy & racy' but this decreases as time goes by. Either way, it's a very strong Sativa effect!

The bloom time of Desfrán
Desfrán being an almost pure Sativa variety she also has a relatively long flowering time. On average, this is somewhere between 9-12 weeks. The fastest phenotypes will take around 9 weeks to be ready for harvest and the slowest around 12 weeks. Of course, ideal conditions lead to faster ripening, while problems lead to slower flowering. Due to her great stretch during the flowering phase, plants grow quite tall.

Desfrán can continue to stretch for around 3-5 weeks after the clock is set to 12/12. Plants 1.5-2 meters tall are common, especially when grown naturally in large pots. It is therefore recommended to grow this lady in a SCROG or to top her early and if necessary to check her stretch somewhat with the help of bending, snapping and supercropping.

You can also grow her directly from seed on a 12/12 grow cycle, preferably in a SOG, for a total harvesting period of 2.5-3 months (cannabis seed to harvest). Due to her long flowering period, she is not suitable for outdoor cultivation in temperate climates. However, she is very suitable for growing outdoors in areas around the equator, where it is nice and warm and sunny. Her high elongation in combination with the plant and bloom structure makes her ideal for warm areas with only 12-14 hours of daylight per day.

The yield of Desfrán
This is a fast flowering pure Sativa with a very high yield. Desfrán hasn’t been given an XXL marking for nothing. This lady grows fast and produces a lot of buds. When you grow her in a SCROG you will see that she can fill the entire room in a short time! Indoors in a controlled growing environment she will yield around 500-600g/m2 on average.

However, in the hands of an expert, higher yields are possible and can even reach 750 g/m2. Pure Sativa strains like Desfrán are not always easy to grow and require some knowledge of cultivation before you can achieve top results with them. Novice growers can certainly grow her with success, but don't expect the highest yields if you've never worked with a classic Sativa.

It requires some experience and knowledge before you know exactly how to deal with this. Outdoors in a dry and sunny climate, or in a controlled greenhouse, this strain can grow to epic proportions. The plants can reach a height of 4-5 meters in ideal conditions and about the same width.

Advice from our experts
This is a strain for the advanced grower and lovers of pure Sativa cannabis strains. Desfrán is a real 'light feeder'. This means that she can tolerate high light levels and also makes excellent use of this to grow even harder and faster. In terms of nutritional needs, she can be quite challenging to perfect at times. A tip is to ensure a lower nutritional dose than you are normally used to and build this up very gradually.

During the complete cycle, this strain requires less nutrition than others. An additional advantage of this variety variety is that it can withstand warm temperatures. Temperatures of 30-35 degrees Celsius are less of a problem. Although this can provide a slightly more airy structure, Desfrán can handle this perfectly.

For best results in an indoor grow, we recommend keeping it a little cooler and growing her with a maximum temperature of between 27 and 29 degrees Celsius. If you work with large pots and an average pre-growth period, you can achieve the same yield with only a few plants per m2 as you normally get with a room full of plants! Be aware of prolonged stretching and during the first 2 weeks of flowering make sure to manipulate her slightly if you want to control her height.

Information about Desfrán
Desfrán is a unique photoperiod cannabis plant. Unlike other pure Sativa-dominant hybrids, our Desfrán finishes relatively quickly, with a flowering time of up to 12 weeks. She is one of the best varieties Alberto has ever come across and we hope you will love her too!"
Frisian Duck,"Why should I get Frisian Duck feminised seeds?
Stealthy variety that is ideal for growing in populated areas

Very tough and easy to grow, ideal for greenhouse and outdoor growing

Grows like a Christmas tree with large flowers and a huge yield

Beautiful purple flowers with a spicy, piney and fruity aroma

Frisian Duck has a subtle yet spicy aroma and flavour profile
Frisian Duck is a hybrid cannabis strain that is bred for its distinctive leaf shape which looks like a ducks footprint. She grows without being recognisable as cannabis for much of her life. Her compact buds have quite a subtle spicy aroma with hints of fresh forest, pine and citrus. The aroma isn’t that pungent, helping her to maintain a low smell profile even when the big purple flowers have matured and dominated its looks.

What does Frisian Duck taste like?
Frisian Duck has a slightly fruity, piney taste that can have hints of berries and fresh forest. Some phenotypes express a more citrus dominated flavour profile. Being slightly citrus and piney, her aroma profile definitely wakes you up! Perfect for a morning or daytime smoke.

Frisian Duck is an outdoor champion
Frisian Duck has purple buds with a hybrid bud structure which leans slightly to the Sativa side. She can be prone to foxtailing, making her buds a bit more open yet very resistant to prolonged periods of bad outdoor weather.

Being the product of a hybridisation of Ducksfoot x Frisian Dew, Frisian Duck has the potential to yield quite heavily. Her Frisian Dew parent genetics ensures healthy and strong offspring which are tough enough to take a punch or two. Besides thriving in an outdoor environment, Frisian Duck will also do well indoors. She stays fairly compact and doesn’t need much height management in order to yield well. Note that her purple tones can be a little less vivid indoors, compared to outdoor grown bud.

A top-choice for the outdoor urban home grower
Frisian Duck grows with unusually shaped leaves making it difficult to identify as traditional cannabis but making it ideal for outdoor and greenhouse growing in populated areas. The ‘Duck’ name refers to the distinctive leaf shape which looks like a duck’s footprint, especially during the first two-thirds of her life. During bloom, some upper leaves may show the more traditional cannabis shape.

What was first seen as a freaky cannabis plant about 5 years ago has now become a household name and bestseller in the Dutch Passion seed collection. The special stealthy looks make this plant a great choice for the urban outdoor cannabis grower. It is a unique cannabis plant in disguise. She is also tough and easy to grow, perfect for less experienced growers.

Frisian Duck is ready to harvest after around 8-9 weeks of bloom indoors. Outdoors she can reach maximum heights of 2-3m and is harvested around the start/middle of Autumn.

The genetics used to create Frisian Duck ensure the following characteristics:

A reliable stealthy variety. Easy to grow and suitable for all growing conditions

A Christmas-tree style plant with strong stems and huge yields

Purple buds with an amazing fresh, fruity and spicy aroma

Frisian Duck is a true outdoor champion, highly suited for outdoor and greenhouse growing even at more northern and southern latitudes where other varieties would struggle to survive.

Frisian Duck effects
Frisian Duck produces fresh, piney and fruity/citrus leaning, tasty buds. The effects of the purple sativa flowers are quite mellow and uplifting. This variety is not the most intense and suits the grower who doesn't want the strongest psycho active experience. She gives the user a pleasurably smooth and well-balanced high, during which they will still be able to function and take care of things. Outdoor activities will become more enjoyable after smoking Frisian Duck. The high is of medium strength and duration.

The growth and flowering time of Frisian Duck
Frisian Duck doesn’t stretch or grow as tall as more Sativa dominant varieties. She is a medium to large sized plant which will almost double in size during bloom. Indoors she is quite easily controlled. Outdoors she can become a real monster, often growing into a huge Christmas tree shaped cannabis plant. Indoors, a veg period of 4-6 weeks would be sufficient to get large yielding plants.

Growing her indoors in a SOG set-up is possible and recommended for higher yields. Although she can thrive indoors, we recommend growing her outdoors as the real power lies in her outdoor potential. She really flourishes in any outdoor grow and is the perfect fit for the outdoor grower looking for a stable cannabis variety which is able to cope with long periods of bad weather. There is no need to train or crop the plants. She grows easily into a big Christmas-tree with tough stems that can hold quite some weight.

The flowering time is about 8-9 weeks. In combination with the recommended veg phase it will take around 12-15 weeks from seed to harvest.


The yield of Frisian Duck
Frisian Duck produces XXL harvests of amazing purple flowers; between 400 and 500 grams per m2  is possible. The plant will carry heavy buds that will smell like you stepped into a fresh forest!


Our expert advice:
Frisian Duck is the go-to variety if you are looking for a strain that will blend in well with your outdoor garden plot or guerrilla spot. This is the stealthiest cannabis cup winning variety available anywhere in the world. If you need an outdoor cannabis strain that camouflages itself then Frisian Duck is the strain for you.

For the bulk of her life, Frisian Duck is difficult to identify as cannabis. Without the distinctive cannabis leaf shape people simply walk right past without giving her a second glance. This stealthy self-hiding cannabis strain is the product of many years of careful breeding and has been optimised for growing in tough northern European outdoor conditions.

Because the unusual leaf shape doesn't attract second glances you can consider grow locations which you may not have considered before. Perhaps you could hide a plant in the corner of your garden or a polytunnel?

Experienced guerrilla growers find that Frisian Duck blends into the background vegetation very easily. Grow this variety outdoors with a few bushes and nettles around her and watch the unique Frisian Duck genetics do a remarkable job of natural self-camouflage. She is only really identifiable as cannabis just before harvest when the buds are ready.

There is no need to tuck or pluck the leaves on Frisian Duck. The growth pattern is perfect for natural growing. If you want a bushier plant, we recommend topping her once. When growing her outdoors be sure to give her sufficient soil and space since she can grow into a real monster in good quality outdoor conditions. Greenhouse growers also need to give her enough space to grow because she can really thrive in such an environment. It’s not uncommon to see greenhouse grown Frisian Ducks reach 3m tall, and just as wide.

More info about Frisian Duck
Frisian Duck is one of the most unusual feminized cannabis varieties available today. It’s the only cannabis cup winning, stealth cannabis strain which is ideally suited to outdoor cultivation in tough northern European conditions.

Frisian Duck grows with a stabilised natural leaf deformity. This produces a natural ‘webbing’ between the individual leaflet ‘fingers’ on the cannabis leaves. This makes her difficult to recognise as cannabis. Most people expect to see the normal leaf shape and wouldn’t give her a second look. The unusual leaf shape, especially during early growth, delivers natural cannabis camouflage which the outdoor grower can use to great advantage.

Besides being a stealthy variety for any outdoor cannabis grower Frisian Duck is a tough and durable outdoor cannabis strain which can give abundant yields to both beginner and expert growers.

Frisian Duck reviews
Since she was first released, Frisian Duck has become one of the most popular outdoor feminised seeds with a reputation for heavy yields and easy growth. She is mainly grown outdoors, in greenhouses or in poly tunnels. In nearly all cases, the growers have an extremely high value for the unique naturally camouflaged leaf shape which maximises the chances that this plant remains unrecognised and therefore likely to reach harvest safely.

This Frisian Duck overview gives advice and recommendations for growing Frisian Duck. The pictures show the superb natural camouflage on offer to the grower seeking a stealthy variety.

This outdoor Frisian Duck grow review shows images from several growers who used the stealth leaf shape to great effect and enjoyed heavy harvests. Note that even in the often cold, wet and dull northern European summers this variety is tough enough to thrive.

Think Fast,"Why should I buy Think Fast feminised seeds?
Think Fast is a unique fast flowering Sativa dominant hybrid. The autoflower genetics of our Auto Think Different and our classic photoperiod Power Plant are hybridised in this great crossing.

This is an easy to grow photoperiod cannabis plant, suitable for beginners and experts alike.

Think Fast is a stable, robust and tough indoor and outdoor variety. Her recessive autoflower genetics make her fast and powerful, suitable even for outdoor cultivation in moderate climates.

Think Fast has an average flowering time of 8 weeks and produces aromatic buds with a thick white resin coating - giving her great bag appeal!

Think Fast has a complex and extensive terpene profile with fresh sweet notes of citrus, diesel, herbs, pine and earth. Ideal for the pheno-hunter!
Think Fast has a complex terpene profile that can produce a wide variety of scents and flavours. Ideal for the pheno-hunter who is looking for something special for his collection. As a result of crossing her 2 well-known parents, Auto Think Different and Power Plant, our Think Fast guarantees a tasty end result.

Most plants have a citrus-dominant terpene profile with notes of diesel, herbs and pine. Sometimes plants can also be found that combine a sweet and fruity profile with more floral notes. As far as we are concerned, they are all special and we are convinced that you will easily find something that will appeal to you enormously!

The aroma of this fast flowering Sativa is quite strong but not extremely pungent. Its full and complex taste stimulates the senses. She is also known for a thick, sticky white resin layer that will completely cover the buds towards the end of the flowering phase.

Think Fast is a fast flowering Sativa with a large yield
Think Fast® is a unique crossing of fast flowering genetics from our Auto Think Different and Sativa dominant classic Power Plant. By combining an autoflower with a photoperiod you get a fast photoperiod plant with a shorter flowering time.

Our Think Fast combines the fast flowering time and powerful high of our Auto Think Different with the tasty terpene profile and the very generous yields of our Power Plant.

What kind of genetics are exactly in Think Fast?
Dutch Passion proudly presents the non-autoflowering version of the legendary Think Different! Think Fast is the result of a cross between Think Different and a specially selected clone of our classic cannabis cup winning Power Plant. The first generation of offspring normally used for further selection showed unexpected results. When an autoflowering plant is crossed with a non-autoflowering (photoperiod) variety, none of the offspring will be autoflowering.

The Dutch Passion geneticists discovered that these non-autoflowering plants, which do carry the recessive 'autoflowering' gene, are significantly faster than their photoperiod parent.

Think Fast is an easy to grow Sativa dominant hybrid with a short flowering time and a large yield
Think Fast has vigorous growth and fast flowering due to the recessive autoflower genes which are present. This ensures that this variety is ready faster than most traditional Sativa dominant photoperiod cannabis strains. Think Fast does need a change in light hours (to 12/12 light cycle indoors and shorter days outdoors) to initiate the flowering process.But she grows larger and faster than traditional photoperiod varieties.

Think Fast can be grown both indoors and outdoors. It was originally developed for indoor cultivation, but thanks to her fast auto genes she also does very well in an outdoor climate. This is the ideal solution for Sativa enthusiasts who live in a moderate climate but do not want to grow autoflowers.

With the right pre-growth indoors, this can become a true monster outdoors. Plants of 2-2.5 m can be produced without too much effort. Outdoor yields can range from a few hundred grams to a few kilograms. This obviously has to do with the growing conditions and the number of hours of sunlight per day, but also with the level of knowledge and care provided by the grower.

Very high yields are possible in the hands of an expert. However, she also does well in the hands of a beginner.

This strain responds well to topping, fimming, cropping and supercropping and is also good for growing as a multi-topped bush. The flowers of Think Fast have a very thick resin layer and therefore they are also suitable for making hash or other cannabis concentrates.

During the flowering phase, she has a medium stretch and her internode distance is short to medium. This Sativa dominant hybrid is suitable for both SOG and SCROG growers. But of course you can also grow her naturally without using any growing techniques.

The genetics used for Think Fast guarantees the following properties:

A very fast flowering Sativa dominant hybrid
A plant with a vigorous and short flowering period, this variety is suitable for both indoor and outdoor growing
Think Fast is able to produce a high yield. This unique strain combines the power and robustness of an autoflower with the yield and potency of a photoperiod strain
Think Fast is easy to grow even for a beginner, very high yields are possible in the hands of an expert.

Effects of Think Fast
Think Fast produces a powerful up-high that can last for several hours. This is certainly not weak weed! The effect is strong and long-lasting. It is a combination of both a head-high and a body-stone, although the mental effect is slightly more pronounced.

The high gives energy and is often very uplifting, ideal for when you want to get things done. The initial high is slightly euphoric and can promote creativity.

If you smoke a little more Think Fast, you can prepare for an intoxicating high that will make you relax wonderfully but still not lull you to sleep. This strain has a clear hybrid effect which will cause both a mental and physical intoxication. This also makes this variety very interesting for both recreational and medical users.

Due to the powerful long-lasting high, you will ultimately need less weed and you will be a lot more economical with your cannabis buds.

The flowering phase of Think Fast
Think Fast has an average flowering time of approximately 8 weeks. It is a fast flowering Sativa-dominant hybrid that is very vigorous and robust, this lady can take a beating! There are even phenotypes that only need 7 weeks to fully flower. These phenos have inherited slightly more Indica genes from the Auto Think Different.

The buds of these plants are generally a bit more compact and stickier than those of the longer flowering phenotypes.

Think Fast will be ready in October outdoors in more temperate climates. Although there are cases known where it could even be harvested towards the end of September. Even before some of the traditional outdoor photoperiod plants were ready. This fast flowering time makes this strain perfect for outdoor cultivation.

Due to the partial autoflower genetics in this strain, she can handle fluctuations in temperature well and will not be bothered by this even in the open air. The plants are on average 2-3 m high and can also grow considerably in width.

The yield of Think Fast
Think Fast® is a fast and strong variety with a high XL yield. Indoor yields average around 500g / m2. Even higher yields are possible in the right hands. She is easy to grow and can be grown in all sorts of ways. This lady is easy to tame.
Outside (or in a greenhouse / polytunnel) Think Fast can grow to a plant of between 2-3.5 m.

Some phenotypes like to grow in height. With these Sativa dominant ladies it is recommended to top the plant, several times if required. The slightly more compact phenotypes also like to grow in width. All plants can use some support towards the end of flowering to keep the heavy blooms from sagging under their own weight or breaking during a strong wind.

In general, this strain grows out very well and you will be amazed by the high yield in combination with the quality of this cannabis strain!

Advice from our experts
Think Fast is a strong and fast Sativa. She likes to be topped several times - which can be a useful technique for experienced indoor growers who sometimes keep an occasional plant growing vegetatively for 2-3 months before switching the light cycle to 12/12.

Outdoors in a long growing season it is also recommended to top this strain several times. This ensures a wider plant with high numbers of heavy side blooms. Ultimately, the highest possible returns can be achieved by repeated topping.

Think Fast also does well in guerrilla cultivation, but it is important that she is pre-grown indoors for some time. For growers in temperate climates similar to the latitude of the Netherlands, it is recommended to pre-grow her indoors in March / April / May before being brought out in late May / early June.

Put her in a sunny spot, preferably in organic soil and she will do the rest on her own. Remove some leaves several times during the life cycle so that more oxygen gets through the foliage. And make sure you don't leave dead leaves hanging to minimise the chance of mold and bud rot.

Information about Think Fast
Think Fast is a unique cross between an autoflower and a photoperiod cannabis plant. The offspring therefore carry both recessive autoflower genetics as well as the genes of a photoperiod plant. As a result, these ‘fast cannabis’ plants do not flower automatically, they grow as a photoperiod but with the added vigour and speed of an autoflower.

This feature makes it possible to grow large, potent, photoperiod plants with the speed of an autoflower (formerly referred to as autofem). Think Fast inherited the overwhelming yields of our classic Power Plant and is almost as fast and easy to grow as the legendary 'Auto Think Different’!"

This strain is known for its ease of cultivation and excellent yield, the buds grow very large and heavy
Skunk #11 is a true 'all-rounder' and does well in all types of media and growing conditions, great for beginners and experts alike
This is a high yielding, high potency Sativa dominant hybrid. The resinous buds have a strong and pungent Skunk aroma, she has a hybrid high with both physical and mental aspects
Skunk #11 has a classic pungent Skunk smell and taste with earthy and spicy notes mixed with notes of pine and cheese, very pungent and strong
Skunk #11 has resinous buds with a traditional and spicy 'old-school' Skunk aroma. This scent can best be described as very penetrating and powerful. It is a mix of earth and herbs with sometimes piney and cheesy notes, a real stinker! This classic Skunk aroma is sometimes described as a Shiva aroma that can be both a bit sharp and spicy.

In terms of taste, our Skunk #11 also tends to be mostly soil and spice, some phenotypes can also taste a bit like a 'cheese'. Other phenotypes have slightly more acidic notes. It's such a unique and complex flavor that it's really hard to describe. One thing is for sure, the aroma is very pungent and this should also be taken into account!

Skunk #11 is a potent Skunk strain with a high yield
Skunk #11 is a very popular Skunk variety that is loved all over the world for its high yields of the highest quality. In addition, it is a relatively fast bloomer and needs an average of about 9 weeks of flowering to be ready for harvest. It is a powerful Skunk with the well-known Skunk aroma and taste. The high is both physically relaxing and mentally up-lifting. In addition, it is very robust and resistant to all kinds of conditions.

What exactly are Skunk #11 genetics?
Skunk #11 is a stable premium Skunk strain. This classic cannabis seed strain is very homogeneous and potent. She is the result of years of breeding and selection by our top Skunk geneticist. Skunk #11, like our Orange Bud and Euforia, comes from our well-known Skunk selection program from the 1980s. Skunk #1, also referred to as the Original Skunk #1, was a strain created by David Watson, a.k.a 'Sam the Skunkman' and this strain was the basis of our Skunk #11.

The genetics on which this strain is based dates back to the 1970s in California. It is a poly-hybrid where 3 landrace varieties have been crossed with each other - Afghani, Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold. Throughout the growing process, constant selection was made for yield, flowering time, thick resinous buds and the renowned pungent Skunk aroma. Our Skunk #11 builds on this and is a potent Skunk strain that can deliver extremely high yields in the hands of experts.

Skunk #11 is a legendary Skunk strain that grows easily in any type of medium or growing conditions, a true 'all-round' cannabis strain
Skunk #11 is a true cannabis legend. With over a million seeds sold, this is one of the most popular cannabis strains of the 21st century. And for good reasons, this is no ordinary Skunk. Skunk #11 grows vigorously in any growing medium and is suitable for indoor, outdoor or greenhouse use. It is a strong plant with generous yields full of resinous buds. And she manages to achieve this in a relatively short flowering period of 9 weeks on average.

It is a strain that is suitable for beginners and first time growers looking for a robust and reliable variety. She is easy to grow and requires no special conditions to perform well. From a grower's perspective, Skunk #11 is a very versatile and interesting strain. As mentioned before, she can be grown outdoors, in a greenhouse and indoors. But the real potency can be achieved in controlled indoor cultivation. From these Skunk cannabis seeds come plants that grow quickly, both in the vegetative phase and in the flowering phase.

On average she takes about 9 weeks to complete the flowering phase, but there are also phenotypes that are a week, or even 2 weeks faster. Especially when grown indoors in perfectly controlled conditions. On the other hand, outside and in less ideal conditions, she can sometimes take a week or 2 longer. Roughly speaking, this can therefore vary from 7 to a maximum of 11 weeks.

One of the few drawbacks of this strain is that the flowers get so thick and heavy that the branches really need support towards the end of the flowering phase. Inside you can do this with string and sticks, but outside you will need to support her really well, either with a net or with large sticks, ropes and tie-rips. Strong gusts of wind can cause the branches with the largest and heaviest flowers to sag completely and eventually even break.

The buds of Skunk #11 also get a sticky resin layer. This thick layer of trichomes is bursting with terpenes and provides an exuberant aroma and taste, typical of an old-school Skunk. During the flowering phase, this strain stretches quite a bit. Her internode spacing is short to medium and the flowers grow very nicely together. Blooms longer than your arm are no exception!

The genetics used for Skunk #11 guarantee the following properties:

A reliable and robust Skunk strain suitable for beginners and experts alike
Skunk #11 can be grown in any type of grow medium and grow environment, indoors, outdoors or in a greenhouse
It is a classic Skunk with a powerful and pungent aroma, the buds are full of trichomes and very potent
Skunk #11 also has a high yield in addition to her tasty terpene profile and high potency. This lady manages to produce very large buds that do require some support towards the end of the flowering phase.

Effects of Skunk #11
Skunk #11 is a highly rated Skunk and she is one of the strongest Skunk varieties in terms of potency. She gives a nice, famously enjoyable 'high' with no paranoia. Skunk #11 relaxes the body and nourishes the mind. The 'high' is pleasant, nice to chill out, erotic and gives enough energy to function normally and get things done. In this regard, it is referred to as a ‘medium high’ which is preferred by many to an ‘all-out high’ or ‘K.O.’ (knock-out) high.

Although this is a Sativa dominant hybrid, Skunk #11 does not give the bright, energetic and up-lifting effect that you can expect from some Sativas. This strain gives a balanced high that is both energising and uplifting, but at the same time also relaxing and stress relieving. It is a nice hybrid high that has both a physical and mental effect and is perfectly balanced. She certainly keeps you alert and active, but still ensures that you can dream away and relax. Skunk #11 has a relaxing effect that is ideal for use during the day and evening.

The bloom time of Skunk #11
Skunk #11 is an easy hybrid strain with an average flowering time of about 9 weeks. This hybrid cannabis strain has phenotypes that can be a little faster, but also phenotypes that take a little longer. The longest flowering phenotypes are known for their extremely high yields so don't harvest her too early since you may be richly rewarded for patience. She is suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. But she is not suitable for growing in the more northern and temperate climates. She likes a lot of sun, a high temperature and low humidity.

Although the buds can tolerate quite a bit of moisture, she takes a little too long to bloom outdoors  when grown in a temperate climate. In a warm and dry climate in the more southerly regions, she can really deliver epic yields. Plants between 2.5-3.5 meters are regularly seen. In a greenhouse she will need until the end of October or the beginning of November to fully ripen. It is therefore recommended, to those that use artificial greenhouse darkening, to use it earlier in the season than normal.

The Yield of Skunk #11
Skunk #11, like the two other Skunks in our collection, Euforia and Skunk #1, is known for high yields. This Skunk can provide an XL yield without too much effort. Even in the hands of a novice, very high yields are possible. On average this will be between 500-600 g/m2, but in the hands of an expert this can go up to more than 750 grams! It is a real 'powerhouse' variety.

Outdoors yields of 500g, even up to 2kg, are possible. Especially when pre-grown indoors for some time before the start of the outdoor season. Grow her in a sunny spot, preferably in a mega-sized smart pot or root pouch and you'll see what this lady has to offer! Plants over 3 meters high and just as wide will amaze you. In addition, she is not at all demanding or complicated to grow. Provide enough water, nutrition and (sun) light and this Skunk will help you achieve an epic yield.

Advice from our experts
You won't need much advice to grow Skunk #11, she practically grows herself! She is also very easy to feed, she doesn't need much so take it easy. After all, it's always easier to give more nutrients if required than dealing with the aftermath of over-feeding.

The best tip we can give is to provide good support to the branches in late bloom. The flowers will get really top heavy and by the end of the flowering phase most of the blooms will have become so thick that they will struggle to stay upright. In addition, it is recommended to use new carbon filters when growing indoors. This lady can smell sensationally pungent - if you want to stay under the radar, good equipment is an absolute must!

Information about Skunk #11
With over a million cannabis seeds sold, this variety is a guarantee of success. Skunk #11 is a classic feminised Skunk strain of the highest quality for an affordable price. The combination of high yields, potency and powerful aroma and taste have made this strain a favourite among skunk growers."

After many years of testing and development, it has finally been possible to stabilise the chemical profile of this strain. It is the strain with the highest CBD content in our collection, on average this will be around 10-15%, but phenotypes have been found that produce up to 20-25% CBD. The THC level is always low and below 1%, but here too there are some differences to be discovered. Some plants have only 0 - 0.3% THC where others are approximately between 0.4 and 0.8% THC, this also depends on the growing conditions and cultivation equipment.

What kind of genetics are there exactly in CBD Charlotte’s Angel?
The first low-THC variety from Dutch Passion; CBD Charlotte’s Angel. The genetics come from Dutch Charlotte, crossed with Red Angel (CBD-rich cuttings). This new hybrid has introduced many new inexperienced cannabis users to consuming cannabis buds in a pleasant way. Charlotte’s Angel does not give you a strong high like a THC-rich strain. Rather than having an intoxicating and sometimes strong mental effect, this strain actually provides a more relaxed and calming feeling. This makes CBD Charlotte’s Angel very popular with consumers who want to enjoy a tasty joint without getting stoned. She gives a positive feeling of well-being, this cannot be explained without trying it yourself!

CBD Charlotte’s Angel grows strongly with large long buds, her Sativa dominant nature makes her suitable for both the SCROG and SOG cultivation methods
CBD Charlotte's Angel has a strong tendency to grow fast and stretch during both the growth and flowering stages. This lady deserves enough space to reach her full potential. This means that if you grow naturally you can usually work with fewer plants per m2. The plant normally grows in a full Sativa-dominant Christmas tree structure, with large fan leaves and strong side branches that also want to grow quickly. Do not grow her too long in vegetative growth, as this can cause problems in flowering in terms of space/stretch in the bloom phase.

This is a strain that does not like too much nutrition during the growth phase, so build up your dosage gradually and preferably grow completely organically. CBD Charlotte’s Angel is suitable for a variety of cultivation techniques and growing methods. For example, you can top or ‘fim’ her to make her bushier/wider and control her height. You can also bend, snap, ‘crop’ and ‘super crop’ her. The large fan leaves leaves can sometimes block the light from the underlying growth shoots. You can remove or trim these fan leaves, so that the light can pass through better.

Most plants will stretch during the flowering phase for 4-5 weeks. CBD Charlotte's Angel is very vigorous and can grow about 150-300% during this phase. Her plant structure can best be described as large and stretchy. The internode distance is medium to large and the leaves have a structure that mainly conveys Sativa characteristics, large, thin and long with slender blades.

The genetics used for CBD Charlotte’s Angel guarantees the following properties:

A Sativa dominant strain with a beautiful slender plant structure
Strong, fast growing plants with a demonstrably high CBD content and low THC content
Buds with a pungent spicy aroma with notes of diesel, citrus and earth
CBD Charlotte’s Angel is the ideal strain for those looking for a strong plant with a very high proven CBD level and a relaxing, soothing high.

Effects of CBD Charlotte’s Angel
Charlotte’s Angel has a special and unique effect. It is a non-psychoactive variety with medical effects but without the high. She does give a ‘physical high’ which is mainly expressed in a calming and anti-stress effect. Consumers have the same pleasant experience, taste and aroma that they get from THC-rich varieties. You don't feel high, but you still experience a pleasant feeling. This high can also involve mental aspects, but not in the way you might be used to from a THC-rich strain. Some users report a sense of creativity and focus after smoking / vaping this strain. This can of course be made up for with the terpenes that are in this strain. Others indicate that the high has a very relaxing effect on your body, can reduce pain and ensure a better night's sleep.

The bloom time of CBD Charlotte’s Angel
CBD Charlotte’s Angel typically has an average flowering time of between 9 and 12 weeks from the time she is set to 12/12. Most phenotypes will take around 11-12 weeks to fully flower. However, there are also some faster phenotypes (with more Indica dominant genes) that are ready to harvest within 8-9 weeks. These faster phenos also have the most compact buds and sometimes show beautiful colours in the bud (purple / rose-pink tones).

The longest flowering phenotypes may even require an extra week or 2. These very Sativa dominant plants often resemble a jungle Sativa, with very thin leaves, great stretch and a top filled with foxtails. These ladies will have to stand a little longer to fully ripen, but often give a larger plant and a larger yield.

The yield from CBD Charlotte’s Angel
CBD Charlotte’s Angel is a high yielding plant. Her XL mark indicates she has the potential to provide a large yield. Due to the fast vigorous growth and elongation during the flowering phase, you generally get large plants with a high yield. Keep in mind the layout of your space because before you know it she has completely taken over your grow room!

In general, yields of around 400-450g/m2 can be obtained with this strain. However, larger yields are possible in the hands of an expert and with the SCROG technique. 500+ g/m2 is certainly possible if you know how to tame this lady. She is mainly suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to her long flowering time, she is not particularly suitable for growing in moderate temperate climates. If you are looking for a strain for this type of climate, it is better to go for the CBD Auto Charlotte's Angel or the CBD Auto Blackberry Kush.

Do you grow in the tropics or subtropics? Then our photoperiod CBD Charlotte’s Angel can offer a solution. This Sativa dominant lady has the right vigour and structure to thrive in these climates.

Advice from our experts
CBD Charlotte’s Angel excels in a SCROG, but can also be grown perfectly in a SOG or naturally. The best advice we can give is to take sufficient account of the degree of stretch and the final height of the plants. With the SCROG technique you can of course already keep her height under control. In a SOG it is important to work with very short vegetative periods (max 2 weeks), she can also be set to grow under 12/12 lighting conditions directly after germination. With the natural growing method it is important to have sufficient height in your grow room and to have sticks + strings available for the stretching phase.

At the end of the flowering phase, the long branches with large flowers require some support to stay upright. Be careful with food as she doesn't like a lot of food in the early stages so build up the dosage very gradually for best results.

Information about CBD Charlotte’s Angel
This CBD-rich strain has been deliberately stabilised on the chemical profile of the plant as far as possible. The goal was therefore to achieve a very high CBD content in combination with a very low THC content at all times. This has succeeded! Because of this focus, this cultivar brings with it some different phenotypes. Some plants are slightly more compact in structure, faster in flowering and more compact on top. On the other hand, there are also longer flowering phenos that get a lot bigger and stretch a lot during the flowering phase, with a more open top structure. There is something for everyone."

Lemon OG is an Indica dominant strain with rock-hard buds, a high potency level and a fast flowering time
 
Lemon OG is a hybrid cannabis strain with a hybrid plant structure that leans to the Indica side of the genes. It’s a hybrid plant with a compact and bushy stature.  She expresses a hybrid plant structure with thick stems and slightly broader Indica style leaves. Most phenotypes don’t stretch a lot during flowering which makes her an ideal candidate for a SOG grow. With her fast-flowering time of around 8-9 weeks she is known to produce solid yields in a short timeframe. It is a plant that usually doesn’t need much support, her branches are strong and keep the buds upright with ease.
 
It is a potent cannabis variety with a thick resin coating on the buds. The high potency level in combination with the pungent terpene profile makes this a winner. She grows best in stable conditions but will also still deliver in climates that are not completely optimal. The Lemon Skunk genetics have given the OG extra stability and vigour making it also a good strain for beginners.
 
Lemon OG can either be grown the natural way or in a SOG. You can choose to use several growing techniques in case you want to restrict her height even further. Keep in mind that these plants won’t stretch a lot after flipping the clock to 12/12. Therefore, it is recommended to give her a slightly longer VEG period to optimise yields. It can be beneficial to tuck/pluck away some leaves in order to increase light penetration and airflow at the end of the VEG period.
 
You will notice a rapid development of trichomes as soon as the vertical stretch has stopped, at the moment the plants are starting to put their energy into the production of flowers. Most phenotypes get completely covered in resin, even during the early stages. A wonderfully fruity, zesty Lemon Kush aroma will fill up the room and you will immediately know why this strain is so appreciated by connoisseurs.
 
She has a low to modest stretch for about 1,5-2,5 weeks in flowering. Most plants start showing flowers already in week 2. Resin development starts early and as soon as the flowers appear you will see a white shimmering of trichome glands appear on the leaves. Her plant structure is short and compact, most plants stay rather bushy. The internodal distance is short to medium. Flowers can grow into big, massive cola’s, especially for the ones on the main branch. That’s why she is very suitable for a SOG grow.

 
The genetics used to create Lemon OG guarantee the following traits:
A strong Indica dominant variety with a fast-flowering time of about 8-9 weeks
Lemon OG only has a low stretch, and most plants stay bushy and compact, her thick main cola’s and fast flowering time make her an ideal candidate for a SOG

Anyone looking for help getting a good night’s sleep will find the indica effects of Lemon OG to be the perfect solution.

 
Lemon OG flowering time
 
Lemon OG has a low to medium stretch during flowering. She needs around 8-10 weeks on average, but there are phenotypes that can be even a little faster than that. Being a hybrid cross this strain can show a few different phenotypes ranging from Lemon Skunk to a more like classical OG Kush and anything in between. The bud structure seems to be more Skunk than OG, but with the compactness of a solid Indica.
Lemon OG is best grown indoors. But she can also be grown outdoors in warm and sunny climates. A greenhouse or polytunnel is a suitable place to grow her too, but only if you have a way to control the humidity as well ensuring a proper airflow. She doesn’t like still air and, especially during late flowering, it is important to keep humidity low. Using temperatures that are lower or higher than the ideal range of 20-27 ºC during flowering won’t hurt her significantly. She can even thrive in colder outdoor conditions. Most plants will need until the middle of October in the Northern Hemisphere to be ready for harvest.

 
The yield from Lemon OG
 
Lemon OG has a large yield of about 500 g/m2 when she is grown in optimum conditions. She thrives in a SOG grow and you can achieve the highest possible yields when you grow with this technique. She is about 65% Indica and 35% Sativa. Indoor plants will average around 75-100cm in size, of course depending on the number of vegetative weeks you gave her. About 3-4 weeks is minimal when you grow with just a few plants per m2. 5-6 weeks is advised when you want to aim for the highest yields.
This variety can grow into very big plants outdoors. Plants of about 2-2,5m in height are quite normal and if grown correctly these plants can generate a high yield. A total yield of around half a kg per plant is possible but only when she receives ample sunlight and when she is grown in good quality soil. More is possible in the hands of an expert or when you grow her in a controlled (and well-ventilated) greenhouse with a prolonged VEG period.

 
Advice from our experts
 
Lemon OG tends to stay low and relatively compact. She doesn’t stretch excessively. Because of her strong indica content, we recommend giving her a week or two more veg growth than you normally do. This helps to optimise and increase the yields. For the highest cannabinoid content and the richest terpene profile we recommend the use of LED grow lights to allow these fine genetics to reach optimum quality levels. When you want her to go that extra mile you could even add some UVA/UVB lights at the end of the grow. But even without the use of additional lights this cannabis seed variety will come out super potent and terpy!

Not one of the tallest plants. It’s a solid hybrid strain that has a pretty strong resistance and isn’t hard to grow.
Kosher Haze might be a bit more Indica leaning, around 70% Indica and 30% Indica. She is a real pleasure to grow and very forgiving. She can handle temperature swings well and won’t fail to deliver high yields. Her Indica heritage is seen in the density of the buds as well as the fast-flowering time that will take around 8 to 9 weeks on average. Nutrient wise she is easy to understand, plants will show quickly if they receive too much or not enough nutrients. This makes her a good strain for beginners to learn the art of growing.
 
There are some phenotypes that might show a stronger tendency to stretch, these more Sativa leaning hybrids can be bent or ‘supercropped’ in order to restrict their height. Others are more compact and bushier, and these are perfect candidates to be grown in a SOG. All plants are known for getting big heads and these flowers have a good calyx-to-leaf ratio. They become pretty dense will put down quite some weight on the scale.

She has a modest stretch of about 2 weeks during flowering. Most plants start showing flowers already in week 2. In week 3 the vertical growth has come to a standstill. Her plant structure is medium height, most plants stay rather bushy. The internodal distance is short to medium. Resin development starts early and the flowers tend to get bulky and chunky.
 
The genetics used to create Kosher Haze guarantee the following traits:
A solid Indica dominant hybrid with a fast-flowering time of about 8-9 weeks
A plant that is easy to grow and understand, therefore suitable for beginners. She will get big flowers with a favourable calyx-to-leaf ratio
Kosher Haze plants usually don’t stretch a great deal making this a strain which is easy to predict and manage. You can use growing techniques to restrict the height of the bigger phenotypes
It’s a potent cannabis strain that will produce dense and compact flowers that are coated in thick layers of trichomes. These buds produce a wonderfully pungent aroma


Effects of Kosher Haze

Kosher Haze has a strong hybrid effect. Because of its high THC content, the effect of this strain is known to be very powerful and long-lasting. It starts off as an energetic feeling that can stimulate creativity and clear thoughts. Its mental aspect comes from the Sativa part of the genes and citrus terps, making it slightly uplifting and euphoric. On the other hand, there is a strong earthy and piney aroma & taste. These kushy terps blend in perfectly with the citrus and gassy terpenes coming from the Karel’s Haze. This will make you feel stoned and physically numb as well. It can cause your body and muscles to relax and especially when taking higher dosages this psychical relaxation will be more pronounced. Most people will experience a potent high that can eventually cause a couchlock stone, especially when you consume a higher dosage.


Kosher Haze flowering time

She has a medium stretch when the lights are flipped to 12/12. The flowers start to appear from week 2-3 in bloom. She needs about 8 weeks of flowering on average, but some phenotypes might be a bit faster and others a bit slower. Therefore, it’s safe to say that the flowering time will be in the 7-9 weeks range. Kosher Haze is an Indica dominant hybrid cannabis seed strain, which is shown in the short flowering time of some plants. The bud structure is very typical to that of a Indica dominant hybrid as well, dense, compact and bulky.

Kosher Haze can be grown outdoors and in greenhouses, but she has officially been bred as an indoor variety in which you can control the environment. Although she handles temperature swings like a champ, a high humidity environment can cause problems at the end of the flowering phase. Therefore, it is only recommended to grow her in controlled greenhouses or in places with a shelter and enough moving air (wind) when you are growing in high temperature climates. When you want to grow her outdoors in soil (garden or guerrilla) we recommend to only grow her in dry and hot climates. Outdoor growing in the Mediterranean might be suitable. She will be ready near September, especially for the fast-flowering pheno’s.


The yield from Kosher Haze

Kosher Haze has an extremely large yield when grown in optimum conditions. It is very likely to achieve results of more than 500g/m2. On average yields of about 400-500g/m2 are possible even for new growers. Experts can top that with massive yields that might reach 550-650g per m2. Indoor plants will usually end up somewhere between 0.75 – 1.25m tall.
 
Outdoor plants can become very big, especially when grown in conditions with a long vegetative period. Plants of about 2-3m are normal. For those outdoor growers a yield of more than 500g per plant is rather the rule than exception. In the hands of an expert and in the right climate yields of more than 1kg of dried buds per plant are not extremely difficult to achieve.


Advice from our experts

Kosher Haze is a solid hybrid with a high yield and a high potency level. Indoors plants may reach 1,5 meters, especially if left untrained. That’s why some growing techniques can be used to keep a more even canopy and thus increase yields. First of all, you can top the plant above the third to fifth internode in order to get multiple blooms and a heavy yield! Other techniques like bending, cropping and supercropping can also be used to ensure a flatter canopy. The buds can become super fat and dense, therefore it is important to provide sufficient support with either a net, or with ropes and canes so they won’t topple over or break.


Information about Kosher Haze

We have been working on this cross for some time and the team are particularly impressed with the wide variation in the terpene profile of many different phenotypes. These ladies share the best characteristics of both parents. We fell in love with this great new THC-rich strain that we even made a Fem Gem (feminised seed version) out of her! Kosher Haze is thus available in both regular and feminized cannabis seeds."

Once lit you will clearly taste the more fruity and sour tones. She has a fruity, gassy taste on the inhale and a sweet grape taste on the exhale. These nugs will leave you craving for more!


Super Mad Sky Floater is a variety that is easy to grow with insanely high THC levels

Super Mad Sky Floater has an extremely high THC content of more than 25% in optimum conditions and is thus very suitable for both medicinal as well as recreational growers. She isn’t hard to grow at all, she remains shorter than the average hybrid which makes her suitable for both a SOG and a SCROG type of grow. She is well suited for areas with height restrictions as long as you don’t overextend the pre-growth period. In case you want to SCROG, make sure to give her a big pot so her roots have enough space to grow big as well.


What kind of genetics are there in Super Mad Sky Floater?

Super Mad Sky Floater is a fantastically potent hybrid indica/sativa feminised seed variety with some of the highest THC levels we have ever seen. This elite hybrid is grown for the quality rather than the yields (which are still above average). THC levels between 25-30% have been seen from this variety which features genetics from Hash Plant, Blueberry and NYCD. We have taken the Blueberry x Hash Plant cross (sometimes referred as Blueberry Hash or Blue Hash) and crossed it again with a NYCD (New York City Diesel/East Coast Sour Diesel) clone. The goal was to include that pungent diesel aroma and taste to the already strong terpene profile of the Blueberry X Hash Plant. Potency was already high in both strains but with this new cross the potency even turned up another notch! This is no bud for the beginner, it has a very potent effect that will last for a very long time. It has the ability to completely blow your socks off so beware!


Super Mad Sky Floater is a well-balanced hybrid that is easy to grow and very suitable for a SOG or SCROG grow

Super Mad Sky Floater grows very vigorously, and she grows pretty wide too. This ensures you don’t need many plants in order to quickly fill up your space. She is a fast grower and therefore she usually doesn’t need a long VEG period, especially if you grow her in a SOG. About 1-2 weeks if you are growing with about 10 plants on a m2. With 16 plants per m2 you can even grow her directly on 12/12 from seed. Growers that are using just a few plants per m2 can use a growth time (18/6) of about 4 weeks. When you do a single plant in such a grow area you only need 6-8 weeks of VEG.
The sativa genetics in this cross make this variety easy to manipulate in your grow room and  also make her suitable for a SCROG grow. Total bloom time is around 9-10 weeks and growers should note that she can double/ triple in height during flowering. Those growing in larger containers may notice the most stretch. The plant is easy to handle and can easily be bent and (super)cropped, although she prefers to be placed in a SOG (sea or green).


Super Mad Sky Floater is a polyhybrid that truly excels in the hands of passionate growers. She shows a beautiful variety of phenotypes ranging from pinkish/purple to green. The difference in phenotypes is also shown in the complex and varied terpene profile that is to be found. The aroma can vary from very gassy and diesel like to a more fruity, berry and grape like aroma.
Most of the plants become medium in height, with big separate flower clusters that can become pretty compact. Her potency is what makes this strain so good. Expect resin coated buds that will sparkle tremendously especially when you hit them with a (flash)light. She is not the biggest yielder but definitely compensates with its high potency and amazing taste. Her taste is very layered and pretty unique, you just have to try it yourself, we know you won’t be disappointed!


It’s a medium to large sized plant with medium internodes. She has a pretty big stretch from the moment the lights are flipped to 12/12. Indoors she grows with solid branching and big flower clusters. Most plants will double/triple in height during flowering, so it is best to plan accordingly. They usually show the most stretch during the first and second week but some more Sativa leaning phenotypes can stretch well up to the end of the 3rd week.


The genetics used to create Super Mad Sky Floater guarantee the following traits:
A medium sized plant with vigorous growth that is easy to grow
Super Mad Sky Floater has a good stretch during flowering and can be grown on 12/12 from seed in a SOG with multiple plants per m2
She is one of the most potent strains we ever came across, THC levels that can be well above 25% in optimum conditions and her aroma and taste is a true connoisseur’s delight


Super Mad Sky Floater is a cannabis strain that is well suited for growers looking to have something special for in their private collection/head stash. It’s a variety that will surely leave its mark on you and is known to impress even the most hardcore smokers


Effects of Super Mad Sky Floater

Super Mad Sky Floater’s high THC content is sure to give you a strong effect that hits quickly. Overall, the effect is super relaxed with a wonderfully powerful wave of euphoria. Being a hybrid, the effect will have both physical as mental aspects. It largely depends on the phenotype too. Some will have a more stoned effect, others a more energising Sativa up-high. The combination of her unique parents has created a very complex taste and a knock-out effect. The taste is so good that you will want more and more, but beware because this will also cause a more intoxicating effect. The high THC levels will appeal to both recreational and medical growers seeking an easy grow experience with an un-compromised, massively powerful effect. One thing is for sure, she will leave you floating up high in the sky!


Super Mad Sky Floater flowering time

Super Mad Sky Floater is a medium to large sized plant with an average flowering phase of about 9-10 weeks. Most phenotypes will take around 10 weeks but there are also longer phenotypes to be found that take 11 weeks. Same goes the other way, the fastest flowering Indica dominant phenotypes can be ready just under 8 weeks. The plants will stretch significantly as soon as the clock is switched to 12/12, she can easily double and even triple in size. Especially when she is pre-grown for a long time and grown in a big pot.
She is not really suitable for growing outdoors in temperate climates. However, she can be grown in heated greenhouses or polytunnels. The best results outdoor will come when she is grown in Mediterranean climates where she receives plenty of sunlight hours each day accompanied by warm temperatures during both the day and night. In these climates (and latitudes) she can be harvested around the middle/end of October


The yield from Super Mad Sky Floater

Super Mad Sky Floater is a plant with a solid yield. She can yield about 500g/m2 in good conditions. In the hands of an expert even higher yields are possible and you might even reach 600g/m2 if she is grown perfectly. The buds are pretty firm and compact, therefore still putting down quite some weight on the scale.
Outdoors she can yield pretty high and between 500g and 1kg per plant is definitely possible to achieve. She prefers a high quality organic (living) soil and many hours of direct sunlight to yield well. Because of her average flowering time of about 10 weeks and her bud structure we recommend to grow her strictly in the more dry and sunny climates. Super Mad Sky Floater isn’t the highest yielder around, but this is well compensated by the insanely high quality of the buds.


Advice from our experts

Super Mad Sky Floater doesn’t require any special growth techniques or nutrient schedules to grow well. All she really needs is a good quality soil and nutrients (preferably organic), some TLC and a passionate grower that is willing to put some work in! She will surely repay you with an amazingly potent harvest. All in all, she is a fairly easy plant to grow and is therefore very suitable for beginners. Being a polyhybrid with a vigorous growth pattern and solid branching structure she loves being bent, cropped and supercropped. Growers that are familiar with these techniques should definitely put them to use when growing this strain. You often see that the branches which are supercropped produce very thick and strong branches which eventually will carry the heaviest flowers. Pinching, topping and FIM is recommended if you grow with just a few plants per m2. This will encourage side growth and will help achieve bigger harvests. We don’t recommend using this when you are doing a SOG grow.


Information about Super Mad Sky Floater

Super Mad Sky Floater is a great hybrid that is on the verge of what modern day cannabis breeding can achieve. It is the perfect mix of crossing some of the most sought-after strains on the planet. Old school classics like Blueberry and Hash Plant come together with the new school funk of the East Coast Sour Diesel. Her offspring shows a beautiful variety of pheno’s with a different aroma, taste and high. It’s pretty difficult to describe in a few words, complex might suit her best and it is this complexity that makes this strain so unique. Don’t wait any longer and experience this yourself!"

Lava Freeze has a pungent aroma with mainly earthy, sour and fruity tones, her taste is gassy and diesel like

Lava Freeze has a pungent aroma and a rich taste. She is widely celebrated for her deliciously fruity and sour terpene profile with hints of mint, cake and chocolate. Her aroma is generally mostly earthy, sour and fruity. She does have a few phenotypes that can have a kush-like aroma. The taste however leans more to the gassy side of the spectrum. Diesel, mint and floral tones can leave a strong aftertaste. She can have a sweet & sour fruity taste on the inhale and a minty gassy diesel taste on the exhale. This incredibly layered taste makes you want to smoke more and more as soon as she is lit.


Lava Freeze is a resilient and robust cannabis variety, which can be grown both indoors and outdoors

Lava Freeze has a strong genetic background which makes her pretty vigorous and resilient. She is strong enough to be grown in temperate climates almost anywhere in the world (except for the most Nordic or Southern regions). Her fast flowering time is very useful for growers that are living in a temperate climate, where the daylight hours and temperatures quickly diminish during autumn. She is suitable to be grown in the Netherlands and at similar latitudes in Canada/USA but also in the UK, Germany and so on. Outdoors her leaves can get beautiful reddish, purple tones and sometimes even completely black colours. It will give the flowers an amazing bag appeal. Of course, she also thrives in a controlled indoor environment where all the environmental conditions are closely regulated and monitored. In here you can get her potency up to a level that will match some of the strongest strains you’ve ever had!


What kind of genetics are there in Lava Freeze?

With crossbreeding our Friesland Indica (M33 for the old school growers) with Lava Cake, a new hard hitting, couch-locking and very tasty hybrid has been born. Back in the day, the original Friesland Indica, a.k.a. M33, a.k.a Freezeland, became immensely popular in North America. In Canada it immediately became a treasure among cannabis seed connoisseurs. It was praised for its productivity, effect and great taste. Friesland Indica was also very robust and able to cope well with the harsh outdoor climate in Canada. This made it a go-to strain for many Canadian commercial underground growers and it can still be found today in many Canadian grow rooms.


Our Lava Freeze has the vigour and terpene profile of the Lava Cake and the robustness of the Friesland Indica. This makes her a great strain to grow both indoor and outdoor. This legendary strain has been bred by Karel. The reverted female he used for this cross came from an elite Lava Cake clone that was selected from premium cannabis seeds donated to Karel's son by one of his longtime buddies on the other side of the ocean. Lava Cake has gained increased popularity over the last few years, mostly because of its vigor and awesome terpene profile. Our Lava Freeze is a nice blend of these new school genetics with one of our old school classics.


Lava Freeze is an Indica dominant hybrid that is easy to grow with a quick flowering time of 8 weeks

Lava Freeze is an Indica-dominant cannabis strain with a very fast flowering time of about 8 weeks. She can still have a decent amount of stretch during the first weeks of flowering. She is known to grow quite vigorously even though she is mostly Indica dominant. Her leaf structure starts off pretty Indica dominant, with a broader leaf pattern. Once she becomes older and especially during the flowering phase the leaves turn into a more hybrid style leaf, slightly thinner and bigger.


Most of the plants are medium in size, with thick long branches that can carry quite some weight. These branches are sturdy and will not snap easily. This is a great feature for when you want to grow her outdoors. She will not be easily damaged by strong winds or by small animals passing. This is a strain which isn’t hard to grow at all. She can be grown in both a SOG and SCROG type of grow, or you can let her grow just naturally, it’s totally up to you. This makes her very suitable for beginners.


Her plant structure is sort of average, not very compact but also not very big. It’s a medium sized plant with short to medium internodes. She has a medium stretch from the moment the lights are flipped to 12/12. Indoors she grows into a nice little bush with solid branching and big and chunky looking flowers. Many growers report that this strain grows into a dense, bulbous structure with beautiful dark hues accompanied by a thick layer of white glistening trichomes. She doesn’t produce a lot of leaves in the buds making her pretty easy to trim.


Most plants will stretch during week 1 and 2 of the flowering period. Only a few phenotypes stretch even longer. These plants stay relatively compact due to its Indica heritage. Resin development starts early too, most of the times it starts almost immediately when the plants are starting to show their sex. The leaves surrounding the buds soon get covered in a sticky layer of trichomes.


The genetics used to create Lava Freeze guarantee the following traits:
A medium sized plant with a fast-flowering time
A resilient plant which is easy to grow both indoors and outdoors. She has solid branching with dense buds with a favourable calyx-to-leaf ratio
She is an Indica dominant hybrid plant that is suitable to grow in a wide variety of conditions and with many different growing techniques, ideal for beginners


Lava Freeze is a solid strain for the new school growers that are looking for something reliable and strong. These stable old school Freezeland Indica genetics have received the right amount of terpenes and potency from the Lava Cake making this cross an excellent choice for growers that don’t want to compromise on quality.


Effects of Lava Freeze

Lava Freeze has a very powerful effect which will be appreciated by the more experienced smokers. The smoke is very smooth and the aroma can be very gassy and creamy at the same time. The high itself is pretty strong and relaxing. If you a smoke a bit more than the high can become devastating and narcotic, even causing a strong couchlock. This strain is ideal for taking some time off to relax. The deeply relaxing effects can ease both your mind and your body. It’s the perfect bud to smoke on those lazy days off, when you don’t have anything to do. You will feel a light euphoric lift off on the onset of the high, which is slightly energising and uplifting. Soon after that initial up-high the body effect becomes more evident and you will wander into a deeply physical relaxing state. You can then melt into the couch and feel totally at ease with the environment around you, happy days!


Lava Freeze flowering time

Lava Freeze is medium sized plant with a quick flowering phase. With an average flowering time of around 8 weeks most of the phenotypes will be done within 2 months after switching the clock to 12/12. Some phenotypes might take a week longer, especially when the growing conditions aren’t completely in the right zone. When you experience a phenotype that takes a little longer to finish we advise you to wait until the first amber trichomes appear. Otherwise, you could lose out on potency.


Outdoors most plant will be ready at the beginning of October, still making this a good strain to grow in temperate climates. We recommend to extend the VEG period a bit if you want the biggest plants, due to its medium stretch the plants won’t be extremely big nor tall.


The yield from Lava Freeze

Lava Freeze has a good yield in a relatively short time frame. She doesn’t produce the biggest plants, but the flowers are pretty dense and chunky. So even though the amount of buds may appear low, the yield will still be high. On average you could get around 400g/m2 with this variety.


Outdoors she can yield several hundred grams per plant and in the right hands she can have a harvest of more than 500g per plant. She does need good quality soil and lots of sunlight to achieve this though. It’s a tough and resilient lady and once you’ve mastered her the potential yields will be even higher! For the best outdoor results we recommend using a shelter, polytunnel or greenhouse with sufficient airflow.


Advice from our experts

Lava Freeze can grow rather bushy. Therefore, we recommend to do several sessions of leaf tucking (or plucking) to give enough space and light to the inner shoots for them to grow more vigorously. This can best be done during the vegetative phase. It will also help to increase the potential yield of this strain. Try to be careful if there’s a lot of rain and moisture towards the end of flowering. Due to the compact buds, it is recommended to keep the humidity low when you are growing indoors. When you grow outdoors in a wet and temperate climate try to place the plants under a shelter during late flowering. The colder night temperatures (which she can handle pretty well) will create a beautiful and striking color palette with purple, red and black shades. She can handle a bit of rain but doesn’t like to be soaking wet during the last few weeks of the flowering period.


Information about Lava Freeze

This new Indica dominant hybrid is a great addition to our collection and mixing our old school genetics with some new school genetics is what we are all about. The outcome is pretty unique, and you will be able to find a lot of interesting phenotypes in these packs."

Hardcore weed smokers will absolutely love the oldschool aroma & taste of our TnT Trichome.


TnT Trichome flowers extremely quick and has a thick resin coating

TnT Trichome is known for a super-fast flowering time of about 7-8 weeks. If you’re looking for an extremely potent and fast photoperiod variety then this could be the one. Her Afghani roots ensure a thick resin layer and rock-hard buds. These buds are completely covered in thick resin layers. Both the terpene and cannabinoid levels are high, she is a THC-rich strain with levels easily getting over 20% THC. In the right hands she can even reach levels of close to 25% THC which makes her one of the stronger strains in our collection.


What kind of genetics are there in TnT Trichome?

TnT Trichome is based on pure Afghani genetics which have been stabilised over a few decades by a small group of enthusiastic breeders. The selection that was done during the years was focused primarily on getting very pungent, coffee like aromas in combination with rock hard buds that have a thick resin coating and a high THC level. These old school Indica Afghani genetics ensured it became a tough and reliable strain with a quick flowering period and solid flowers that have a hard-hitting effect that can only be created by the most powerful Indica genetics on the planet. All those years of stabilisation has made this variety an IBL (inbred line), meaning she has very stable and homogenous offspring. When you grow just a few seeds it will not be hard to find a winner and when you grow on a larger scale you will be surprised by the same level of quality that all the plants share.


TnT Trichome is an easy and forgiving plant to grow, she has round shaped golf ball sized buds which are covered in sticky resin

Tnt Trichome is a very easy plant to grow. She has a good nutrient uptake and isn’t easily stressed making her very suitable for beginners too. She grows into a compact little bush with a big dominant main bloom. All of her buds are super dense and compact making this cannabis strain pretty easy to trim. She definitely grows wide instead of high. Her Indica dominant growth pattern becomes very clear from the start of the vegetative phase and will continue throughout the flowering phase.
 
The result is a fat Indica leaf pattern and stout bushy growth. These plants get thick and strong stems which aren’t easy to break. The onset of flowering starts soon after switching the clock to 12/12 and she produces round sized nuggets that look like golf balls. Because of the years and years of stabilisation this has become a highly potent strain which doesn’t show big phenotype differences. Almost all of the plants show the same growth pattern, the same compact buds and the same level of potency.
 
The goal was to create a very powerful strain with a high THC content that would offer great medicinal values too. Being super Indica dominant she is known to induce sleep, help battle muscle aches/spasms and best of all numb pain as no other. She is known to give the user a strong knock-out stone, especially when consuming high dosages.
 
During flowering the plants show low to medium stretch, the internodal distance is short to medium too. The bud sites are pretty close to each other and can become stacked. Most flowers will have a little space between them though. The flowers are not the biggest but all of them are super dense and compact. She grows with sturdy branches, fat leaves and big round flowers. The thick layer of trichomes make these white glistening buds lust-worthy to look at.

The genetics used for TnT Trichome guarantee the following properties:

A short bushy plant with a fast flowering phase
One of the most potent THC-rich strains you’ve ever encountered
Very aromatic flowers that are covered in thick layers of trichomes
Tnt Trichome is a forgiving Afghani Indica with super dense flowers which are easy to trim and easy to grow 
Effects of TnT Trichome

Tnt Trichome is a powerful smoke that will cause a strong body stone and head high that will last for at least several hours. If you smoke a good joint or when you vape a considerable amount of weed then you better be prepared for the munchies as she can improve appetite. The overall effect of this strain is pretty strong and heavy, she will make you feel very stoned, some might even say lazy. We just call it relax & fully medicated!
 
The effect can be heavy on the body, it can also make you feel sleepy. It’s definitely a strong strain that makes you want to sit down and do nothing else but sit back and relax. There is also a head high with a mental aspect but in general that is not as dominant as the body effect. It gives the user a feel-good high which makes you feel happy and calm. In general, it’s a good strain to smoke during the day/evening. But people looking for heavy pain relief can also smoke it during the morning.


How long does it take to flower TnT Trichome?

In general, the plants develop sturdy and thick branches, which makes her very suitable for a SOG setup or for growing the natural way. The compact and heavy buds are well supported by these thick branches. She flowers in about 7-8 weeks, some phenotypes might need a week longer and some can be harvested in just under 49 days. Because of this short flowering period the plants can benefit from a longer VEG period in order to fill up the space in your grow room.
 
TnT Trichome will stretch for about 2 weeks but during this time she doesn’t have a lot of vertical growth. It’s a low stretch and she even might have some trouble doubling in size. On the other hand, this makes her very manageable and easy to predict. Once the clock switches to 12/12 everything starts to change at a rapid pace. Pre-flowers are shown within 1.5-2 weeks and in week 4-5 the buds are gaining a lot of mass and weight already. Resin development starts very early too and you can already see why this strain has such a high THC level during the middle of flowering.


The yield from TnT Trichome

TnT Trichome has a lower yield than you might get from other Indica dominant hybrids. This being a ‘pure’ Afghanica Indica strain makes sure she stays very compact and bushy. She isn’t the largest nor fastest grower, but what she loses in size is made up for in speed. Many plants can be ready under 50 days of flowering, when grown in optimum conditions, so you could save 1-2 weeks compared to other strains. With this speed of flowering, you might even do one extra round/cycle per year. Besides the speed her potency flies through the roof, with THC levels of 20-25%.
 
The average yield of this variety will be in the range of 350-400 g/m2. However, with an extended VEG period and in the hands of an expert grower slightly higher yields are definitely possible (400-450 g/m2). She is very reliable and homogenous meaning it will not be hard to be constantly hitting the same marks over and over again. Instead of leaf plucking we would advise to only cut the edges of some leaves (make them smaller) and only if that is needed to let the light penetrate the canopy to the lower bud sections. This strain can use all the leaf green for photosynthesis.


Advice from our experts

TnT Trichome doesn’t require any specific growing advice nor details about nutrients or growing techniques. It’s a pretty straightforward plant to grow. This makes her suitable for beginners and first-time growers. Because this strain is (close to) an IBL there are not many different phenotypes to be found offering a very homogenous product. It will not be difficult to source the winner you have been looking for! Best tip we can give is to keep the humidity low during the end of flowering. The buds become super dense and rock-hard and they don’t like still air nor a high humidity level. Once you are about to harvest these compact and resinous nugs we would advise to use gloves and clean your scissors on a regular basis. The buds are super sticky and the smell is very pungent too, new carbon filters and a strong extraction system are recommended during the flowering period and when trimming!

Pineapple Poison is a Sativa dominant hybrid that is very resilient and easy to grow with a quick flowering time of about 8 weeks

Pineapple Poison is a Sativa dominant cannabis strain with a strong Sativa structure, her branches are strong and super solid. It’s a vigorous plant that is very easy to grow, both outdoor and indoor. The Sativa characteristics of the Dutch Passion Durban Poison are already quite visible during the growth cycle. During early veg, the plants may look a little more Indica than you might expect. The leaves can be very big and fat, the branching and plant structure is more Sativa dominant but doesn’t have the insanely high stretch that comes with pure Sativa’s.


She is easy to grow and the buds usually have a more Sativa appearance. Indoors she can reach between 1-1,5 meters, especially if left untrained. That’s why some bending and cropping techniques are recommended to keep a more even canopy and increase yields. There is also a phenotype to be found that has smaller buds but with an impressive amount of limonene in it making it a super fruity and zesty aroma. Most of the phenotypes have a complex aroma profile that range from fruity to sweet to herbal with that particular aniseed coming from the Durban. Something that isn’t easy to be find in most of the modern crosses.


Her plant structure is medium to large, she can become pretty big if grown well but her height is still somewhat easier to control. It’s a big plant with a medium internodal distance. The nodal distance on the lower parts of the branches can be a bit larger. The main blooms of the branches often grow into thick and chunky flowers. She has a medium stretch when the lights are flipped to 12/12. The flowers start to appear from week 2-3 in bloom. She needs about 8 weeks of flowering on average but some might be a bit faster and others a bit slower. Therefore, it’s safe to say that the flowering time will be in the 7-9 weeks range.


The genetics used to create Pineapple Poison guarantee the following traits:
A very vigorous Sativa strain with a fast-flowering time
A resilient plant which is suitable for both outdoor and indoor growing. She has strong stems with chunky flowers and a favourable calyx-to-leaf ratio
Pineapple Poison is easy to grow and very suitable to grow in a wide variety of growing conditions, making this an ideal strain for beginners or growers that operate in a climate or growing area that are not completely optimal
She is a strong and robust Sativa that doesn’t require a lot of experience or knowledge about nutrients. Although she doesn’t like a particularly strong feed she can still handle it quite well


Effects of Pineapple Poison

Pineapple Poison has a wonderful taste and a strong effect that will be well appreciated by connoisseurs. Its effect has a good combination of both physical as well as mental aspects. The fruity and herbal terps makes this a real joy to smoke. The high itself starts pretty euphoric and up-lifting. It’s a creative high that makes you feel energised and relaxed at the same time. It’s a great strain if you still want to be able to do stuff. Smoke a bit more and she will make you feel happy and somewhat giggly. As time passes, the initial up high transforms into a more relaxed and overall sense of well-being. The potency of the effect is of medium strength and will last for a few hours.


Pineapple Poison flowering time

Pineapple Poison is a Sativa dominant variety with a fast-flowering time of about 8 weeks on average. Some phenotypes might be even faster, these can be done in just 7 weeks. Other phenotypes, the most Sativa dominant ones might take up to 9 weeks of flowering, especially if the climate or the conditions in the grow room are far from optimal. During the last few weeks, the buds really fatten up and become more compact, so it is recommended to wait until they have ripened far enough. You can check the trichomes with a microscope to find out the right moment to harvest.
Outdoors and in greenhouses most plants will be ready at the end of September. This makes her very suitable for growing in all parts of Europe, even when the night temperatures are starting to drop significantly in September. She also does very well in polytunnels or as a guerrilla plant. There is not much that withhold her from becoming a massive cannabis plant during a few months of outdoor growing!


The yield from Pineapple Poison

Pineapple Poison has a medium sized yield of about 350-450 g/m2 on average. Being a Sativa dominant variety with a quick flowering phase of 8 weeks this is still a high yield if you compare it with other Sativa’s that might take 11-13 weeks of flowering. Her buds are very chunky and they are still pretty heavy for such a Sativa dominant appearance with foxtails.
Outdoors she can yield more than half a kg without putting in too much effort. Experienced growers can get around 1kg of dried buds when grown in the right conditions with enough sunlight hours per day. She can grow into a perfect bush, especially if you top her several times. If left un-topped, she will become fairly big and plants of more than 3-meter high are not uncommon.


Advice from our experts

Pineapple Poison is a strong and vigorous plant. If you are looking for the highest possible yield we advise topping of the main branch and possibly later on another round of topping of the new main shoots if you are having a long VEG period.


You can also use cropping and supercropping techniques to keep a more even canopy, both techniques will help to improve the yield of the strain. Regarding nutrients, she is a pretty easy feeder, and doesn’t need much expertise to grow well. We recommend keep the EC around 1.8-2 in flower for the best results (maximum of 2.2). You can also grow her completely organically for the tastiest result! As with most strains the best yield and quality indoors will come if you keep her in a stable growing environment. Between 20-29 ºC in bloom works very well and try to keep her humidity low during late flowering for the densest flowers. Don’t worry if you are not able to keep the temperatures below 30ºC, the strain has been tested several times in hot climates and was still able to produce very well. Pineapple Poison is quite homogenous, and the flowers all share that nice Sativa dominant structure and a great recognisable aroma and taste!


Information about Pineapple Poison

Overall, she is just very vigorous, and she reacts well to both topping and (super)cropping techniques. Her branches are strong and sturdy making her very suitable for both SOG and SCROG growers. She is also very resistant to (heat) stress, even in indoor grow rooms with temperatures well over 30-35º C these plants will stay stable and are able to produce some high-quality Sativa flowers. Her chunky flowers have very thin leaves in the buds and a favourable calyx-to-leaf ratio. Some phenotypes have many pistils in the flowers and some might even show some nice colourations in the buds with lilac/purple hints."

Purple OG Punch has very compact buds which are completely covered in trichomes, these white glistening buds have an amazing bag appeal
Purple OG Punch isn’t hard to grow, on the contrary, she is pretty forgiving and easy to grow. Being an Indica dominant hybrid her growth pattern is pretty straightforward, without having too much stretch during flowering or being uncontrollable with a lot of side branching.

She grows like most Indica dominant OG’s with thick sturdy branches, a medium internode distance and a hybrid leaf structure which leans slightly to the Indica side of the genes.

In general, the plants develop sturdy and thick branches, which makes her extremely suitable for a SOG setup or for growing the natural way. The compact and heavy buds are well supported by these thick branches. She flowers in about 8 weeks, some phenotypes might need a week longer and some can look ready at 7 weeks. But 8 weeks is the general threshold for the plants to be ready for harvest.

During flowering the plants show medium stretch, the internodal distance is medium too. The bud sites are pretty close to each other, but not fully stacked. Don’t expect the biggest flowers you’ve ever seen, they can get big, but not huge. What you can expect are some of frostiest and most compact buds you’ve ever seen!

The thick resin coating doesn’t stay strictly on the flowers, the leaves are covered in a thick layer of trichomes too. It’s not just the sugar leaves which are full of resin, the bigger leaves (fan leaves) usually get a nice coating as well.

Her compact and round-shaped flowers are really easy to trim and the sugar leaves are excellent material for making your own hash or other cannabis concentrates.

How long does it take to flower Purple OG Punch?
Purple OG Punch has a rapid flowering time of only 8 weeks. There are even some phenotypes that can look ready at 7 weeks, especially when grown in optimum conditions. However, we usually recommend to flower for at least 8 weeks.

One thing all the phenotypes have in common are extremely resinous buds. Some might even call this strain Purple Sticky Punch, referring to her thick layer of trichomes that is unusually sticky to the touch.

Purple OG Punch will stretch for about 2 - 2.5 weeks during flowering. She has a short to medium stretch meaning she doesn’t grow significantly after switching the daily light hours to 12/12. This makes her a great candidate for a SOG grow and if you do use the SCROG method it is recommended to give the plants a few extra weeks of VEG to fill up the net nicely before switching to flowering.

The yield from Purple OG Punch
Purple OG Punch has a solid yield. This strain is actually known for its triple A+ quality buds which are full of resin, terpenes and cannabinoids. But the yield can be surprisingly good too. The compact, rock hard nugs put down quite some weight on the scale. Whenever she is grown in optimum conditions and by an advanced grower the yield can reach levels that can come close 500 and maybe even 600 g/m2.

Probably for most growers it will be somewhere around 450 g/m2. She does well in a SOG-setup but can also be grown in a SCROG or the natural way. She is a generally a bushy plant with strong and resilient branches, big leaves and super compact flowers. Outdoor growing can be a challenge, especially when you want to grow her in a temperate climate. A low humidity is the key to success.

With a lot of rain and moisture during late flowering it will be a challenge to keep bud rot/fungus at bay. Therefore, it is only recommended to grow Purple OG Punch outdoors in a dry and sunny climate. Or in a well-ventilated greenhouse.

The goal was to create the most pungent and aromatic terpene profile you can encounter. This variety is pretty powerful, with THC levels reaching well above 20%. In optimum conditions you could even get close to 25% THC.

What kind of genetics are there in Strawberry Chemdawg OG?
Strawberry Chemdawg OG is the result of a cross between Chemdawg and Strawberry OG. This poly-hybrid is an unique cross of two heavy weights. Chemdawg aka ‘Chemdog’ is a well-known strain from the USA that became one of the building blocks of world famous OG Kush and Sour Diesel. It is known for its distinct and powerful diesel-like aroma. This is a strain that you will be able to smell from a distance. Pungent and heavy, her terpene profile is both strong and penetrating. All of the Diesel strains came from these genetics including Headband, NYC Diesel etc.
 
The Strawberry OG genetics came from a cross between a Bruce Banner and SFV OG. During the creation of this strain the original breeders were looking for a strawberry flavoured OG, with the classic Bruce Banner structure and the potency of the SFV OG.

The result is a mouthwatering terpene profile that smells and taste like strawberry lemonade with an OG twist. We crossed these two amazing parents to get an even more pungent cannabis variety than either of the original parent strains. You can expect an aroma of diesel, jet fuel, burnt rubber with a hint of strawberry and forest fruit. All with the same pungency level as the original Chemdawg/Chemdog. Our team was really impressed how this cross turned out and we believe you will be too!

Strawberry Chemdawg OG is packed with flavor, this high THC variety has a big yield and a flowering time of 9 to 10 weeks
Strawberry Chemdawg OG is a very well-balanced hybrid with a medium flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks. Her yield can be high in the right hands. She is not particularly hard to grow, but her growth pattern can be difficult to predict. This can be challenging for less experienced growers that are looking for the easiest strains.
 
The Strawberry OG parent is actually a plant that is pretty easy to grow and quite resistant to mold and bud rot. The Chemdawg is a little bit more difficult to grow and especially hard to master. But once you get the hang of it, she produces ultra-flavourful buds that will simply put a smile on your face as soon as you open the jar. Our goal with the new Strawberry Chemdawg OG was to make these terps more accessible to all types of growers.

She grows like a proper Christmas tree with a lot of side branching when grown the natural way. Her branches are tough and resilient, she can be bent, cropped and supercropped.

Grow techniques like LST, mainlining or SCROG will help achieving the highest possible yields. Her flowers tend to get pretty big and bulky, during late flowering.

Therefore you may wish to support the buds with either sticks or ropes so they don't snap the branches. It’s a medium sized plant with a decent amount of stretch after switching the clock to 12/12. She can easily double in size.

Her internodal distance is short to medium, some phenotypes show very good stacking, these are often the highest yielders.
 
The genetics used for Strawberry Chemdawg OG guarantee the following properties:

A medium to large sized plant with a flowering time of about 9-10 weeks.
Her buds are extremely pungent. She has a very high terpene profile which smells like that distinct diesel aroma infused with forest fruit and sour citrus tones.

Effects of Strawberry Chemdawg OG
Strawberry Chemdawg OG is an intensely diesel strawberry OG flavoured strain with a high THC percentage of about 20-25% THC. Though the flowers are gassy, kushy and sweet in taste, don’t let the berry fruitiness fool you into thinking that this isn’t a hard-hitting strain. These multi coloured buds result in you feeling completely intoxicated, after just a couple of drags.

It has a blend of both mental and physical effects, however the mental effects seem to be a bit stronger than the physical ones. The high is a fast hitter and can last several hours. If you smoke a fat spliff you can be high for half the night.

The initial disorienting head high will become more cerebral and uplifting after a few minutes. It has the ability to amplify your senses, making this a great variety to listen to music or to watch movies. Besides having a powerful head high the body stone is nothing near a couch-lock but it will make your body feel totally relaxed.

How long does it take to flower Strawberry Chemdawg OG
Strawberry Chemdawg OG has an average flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks. She is bred as an indoor plant but can also be grown outdoors in favourable climates. She has a more open bulky bud structure which makes her suitable for outdoor growing in warm & sunny climates.

For the best results we strictly recommend growing her outdoors in a dry Mediterranean-like climate or in the comfort of a controlled greenhouse.

This strain has a medium to large stretch, plants can easily double in size. Some of the most Sativa dominant pheno’s can become even larger than that. Her stretch goes on for about 3 to maximum 4 weeks. She can be grown the natural way but she will also do well in a SOG. SCROG growing is where this strain really excels, you can also use many different growing techniques to increase her yield.

The yield from Strawberry Chemdawg OG
Strawberry Chemdawg OG has a very decent yield. Even for the less experienced growers it is still possible to get a good yield of nearly a pound per m2 with the proper level of care. In the hands of expert growers, it is possible to obtain a large yield of around 500-650g/m2. These high yields can only be reached if the plants are grown in optimum conditions.

It is advised to support the heavy flowers during flowering for both indoor and outdoor growers. The use of a net to support the buds is a good solution to keep the heavy flowers upright. It’s a strain that could use the help of some grow techniques like LST, supercropping, scrogging in order to get the highest yields. Outdoors she can yield more than half a kg of dry buds per plant.

Advice from our experts
Strawberry Chemdawg OG is a vigorous plant. Growers should prune and bend them early in the vegetative stage in order to keep their height under control, especially in cases where there is restricted height to work with.

One of the best tips we can give is to make sure you will strip and lollypop her sufficiently. It would be best to strip her at the end of the VEG period, about a week before the flowering starts. You can repeat the process during week 1 and week 3 of flowering. By doing this you ensure that there is enough oxygen flowing through the canopy which will increase the yield. You also minimise the risk of stagnant air pockets that can cause a buildup of moisture, eventually risking bud rot.

The other tip we feel we should point out is that it is important to invest in new Carbon filters before the grow starts. Strawberry Chemdawg OG has the same level of pungency as her Chemdawg parent and it definitely requires a strong carbon filter to get rid of the strong cannabis aroma in the house.

Information about Strawberry Chemdawg OG
Strawberry Chemdawg OG is a powerful hybrid that combines the uplifting and energising effects of a Sativa with the sedation of an Indica. This strain is the perfect blend of 2 heavy weight cannabis genetic lines from the USA.

We loved blending the extremely pungent diesel aroma of the Chemdawg with the more sweet & sour, strawberry and OG profile of the Strawberry OG. We fell in love with this cross and we hope you will feel the same!"
Black Lebanon,"Black Lebanon is a real treat for the true connoisseur of old school strains. This is the original Black Lebanon dating back from the 1980's, a true Hash plant. The producer has been busy with this strain since 2008 and selected the best mothers out of hundreds of plants. This strain is made from two original Black Lebanon landraces, a crossed between Lebanon #1 and Lebanon #5. Of course we took into account our desires towards quality, potency, taste, effect and of course a good yield.

We are very pleased and proud with the successful breeding results. Black Lebanon is one of the strongest landrace strains from Lebanon. She is naturally very resistant to high temperatures and dry climates thanks to the Lebanese landrace genetics.

The plants are very dark green with some leaves showing purple colourations. Some can look almost black. This makes these plants a real treat for the eye. The spectacular appearance is enhanced by the glittering white resinous trichomes which really stand out against the dark foliage of the plant.
 
The taste is a little fruiter than the original Black Lebanon, more flavoursome with less of an earthy taste. The production levels are medium to high, depending on the growers skills and lights used. We recommend a minimum of 600W per m2 of HPS, or perhaps around 400W/m2 of quality LED. In optimum conditions 500 gram per m2 is possible.
She grows between 80cm and 1.50 m tall and is also very suited to the SOG grow technique. SCROG is possible but takes longer because she isn't the stretchiest of strains. Black Lebanon is very sticky and resinous with THC levels reaching over 20%.
 
The indoor flower period is around 60-65 days. Outdoors she can be harvested around the middle of October. Indoors, she is very resistant to stress and high temperatures. The genetic background is very strong and the team were surprised and impressed with the resin levels, terpene profile and bud production. It's not very common to see a plant this vigorous with such growth speed.

So if you want to impress yourself and your stoner friends try it out now and enjoy the relaxing vibes and old school memories from the 1980's."
